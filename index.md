# INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the ***Märchen Engine System Reference Document***, which
outlines the core rules used by this Open Gaming System. This
Introduction provides you with an overview of what the Märchen Engine is
and how it works, while the later chapters show you how to create
characters and embark on your own exciting adventures.

## What Is Roleplaying?

If you are new to roleplaying, you might be asking yourself, “What is a
roleplaying game?”

A roleplaying game (sometimes abbreviated as RPG) is a game in which
players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players
take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative,
either through literal acting or through a process of structured
decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many
games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and
guidelines, such as the Märchen Engine rules.

A session of Märchen Engine play is conducted through discussion. One
player, the Referee, usually arbitrates any decision based on the rules
and presents the setting of the game, while each of the other players
plays the role of a single character. Together, the Referee and players
create a story, much like the way many of us used to create stories
playing games of make believe as young children, except with more dice
and more structure.

## What Is the Märchen Engine?

The Märchen Engine is simply a set of rules for conducting a game based
on classic fiction and adventure stories. Within its pages, you will
find rules on creating characters, resolving tasks, fighting other
creatures and engaging in huge battles, building worlds, enjoy the risks
of speculative trading, exploring new worlds, and a host of other
diverse activities. Although no rules set can be complete, the Märchen
Engine attempts to provide enough rules to allow you to create almost
any science fiction adventure.

The Märchen Engine is inspired by classic fiction games from the early
days of roleplaying and shares a lot of similarities with these gaming
systems. Material from these older rules sets and those created under
the Märchen Engine are mutually compatible with only a minimum of
adjustments required.

To play, you need a copy of the Märchen Engine rules; several dice,
available at game and hobby stores (you'll need two at a minimum, but
more is better); and a pencil and some paper.

## The Core Task Resolution System

The Märchen Engine uses a core task resolution system to resolve
actions. Whenever your character attempts any action with a chance of
failure, do the following:

1.  Roll dice as determined by the characters and their circumstances.

2.  Add any relevant modifiers (for things like characteristics, skills,
    difficulty and circumstances).

3.  If the result equals or exceeds the threshold for success, the
    action succeeds. If the result is lower than the threshold for
    success, the action fails.

This simple system is used for nearly everything in the Märchen Engine,
with variations based on the modifiers added to a roll and the effects
of success and failure.

## The Referee

Within the Märchen Engine rules, one of the players is asked to assume
the mantle of Referee. The Referee is the person who will act as an
organizer, officiant for questions regarding rules, arbitrator, and
moderator for a Märchen Engine gaming session, or an ongoing Märchen
Engine campaign. The role of the Referee is to weave the other
participants' player-character stories together, control the non-player
aspects of the game, create environments in which the players can
interact, and solve any player disputes.

## The Characters

A player character or playable character (PC) is a fictional character
in a Märchen Engine game whose actions are directly controlled by a
player of the game rather than the rules of the game. The characters
that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters
(NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by
the Referee.

Using the Märchen Engine rules as guidelines, a player will create a
character reflecting the sort of role they’d like to have in the game.
The character is usually of a certain race (depending on those available
with the Referee's universe) and possesses a unique combination of
skills and levels of expertise. The attributes of a character is given
as numerical values which can change as the gamer progresses, and
characters grow and develop over the course of their adventures.

## Aspects

All beings have four aspects of their existence. These define the
highest categorical breakdown of a being. They are Physical, Mental,
Social, and Spiritual. They each have a numeric score The higher the
score, the more potential that being has in that aspect of their
existence. These aspects can be broken down into your traditional
Characteristics.

## Characteristics

All characters have certain basic characteristics that define what they
can do. Each of these characteristics fall into a given aspect. Higher
characteristic scores grant bonuses on task resolution checks, while
lower characteristic scores grant penalties. As part of creating your
character, you decide how strong, smart, and tough your character is by
choosing the appropriate characteristic scores. See **Chapter 1:
Character Creation** for more information.

## Skill

Skills represent exposure and/or training in a particular sort of task
or knowledge. Initially you are either trained or untrained in that
skill. Overtime you will gain additional points in the skill as you
excel in your specialization. Skills themselves are not associated with
a given technology level. Skills cannot be above level 4. Once you have
a skill at level 1, you have all associated specializations at level 0.

## Specializations

Every Skill has multiple specializations associated with it. When a
skill is initially learned at level 1 selected it means that all the
specializations associated with it are all at level 0. From that point
on, the any additional study in that skill will require the player to
pick a specialization to study instead. They will start that skill at
level 1. A character may have multiple specializations in a skill.

Each cascade skill level represents roughly two years’ worth of
education and training in that skill. For skills of an academic bent,
you could equate that to an associate degree (or similar two-year
academic program) at level one, a bachelor’s degree (120 hours or other
four-year program) at level two, a master’s degree at level three(40
hours) of experience, a Doctorate at level four(60 hours and beyond).
Once a cascade skill is taken to level 4, the skill its associated with
receives a +1. CascadeSkills are learned at a technology level. Cascade
skills can not be learned past level 4.

Skill levels act as a bonus on task resolutions rolls when a character
attempts an action related to a skill. As your character follows their
career, they gain skills. See **Chapter 2: Skills** for more information
on specific skills.

Being trained in that skill represents roughly two years’ worth of
education, training, and exposure , everything from acrobatic maneuvers
to negotiation, piloting a starship, and programming a computer. Someone
trained in athletics is able to climb faster and with more confidence
than someone who isn't, for example. Skills are measured in levels,
reflecting how much training a character has in the skill. When
recording skills and their associated levels, the skill name is written
first, followed by a hyphen, and then the number of levels that the
character possesses in that skill. For example, Gambling-2 means that
the character has two levels of Gambling skill.

##### Table: Skill Level 

| Level 0 | Trained      |                    |
|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| Level 1 | Apprentice   | Associates Degree  |
| Level 2 | Journeyman   | Batchelor’s Degree |
| Level 3 | Master       | Master’s Degree    |
| Level 4 | Grand Master | Doctorate Degree   |

## Bringing it all Together

### Physical Aspects

#### Muscle Characteristics

**Muscle** represents the overall strength of the being.

##### Ranged Combat Skill

Your Ranged Combat ability check measures your character's ability to
attack and survive in a ranged combat. This skill also allows you to
maintain the general quality of a ranged weapon and to perform general
maintenance to ensure their continued use. It will, however, not allow
you to build, repair, or Jury rig a solution.

##### Athletics Skill

Your Athletics check covers difficult situations you encounter while
climbing, jumping, or swimming.

##### Melee Combat Skill

Melee combat measures your character's ability to attack and survive in
armed melee combat. This skill also allows you to maintain the general
quality of a melee weapon and to perform general maintenance to ensure
their continued use. It will however, not allow you to build, repair, or
jury rig a solution. Melee weapons can be improvised. This skill allows
you to use acquire an improvised weapon.

#### Agility Characteristics

**Agility** represents the overall flexibility and grace of movement of
the being.

##### Stealth Skill

Make a Stealth check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies,
slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on
someone without being seen or heard. You must be out of sight of those
you intend to deceive when this skill check is made.

##### Acrobatics Skill 

Your Acrobatics check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a
tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of
ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck.
You might also need a Acrobatics check to see if you can perform
acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

##### Sleight of Hand Skill

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as
planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your
person, make a Sleight of Hand check. You might also need a Sleight of
Hand check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another
person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

#### Stamina Characteristics

**Stamina** represents the overall ability that being can push
themselves physically.

##### Drive / Ride / Pilot Skill 

Whenever you attempt to ride a horse for a long period of time or over
rough terrain, pilot a boat down a raids or a busy river, or operate a
method of transportation in any way that is taxing in any way you will
need to make a Drive / Ride / Pilot roll to stay on the task and
successfully arrive at your destination.

##### Ruggedness Skill 

Make a Ruggedness check when you attempt to Force open a stuck, locked,
or barred door, break free of bonds, push through a tunnel that is too

attack and survive in an unarmed combat.

### Mental Aspects

#### Intellect Characteristic

**Intellect** represents the overall ability of the being to mentally
understand the world around them

historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes,
recent wars, and lost civilizations.

##### Life Sciences Skill 

A life sciences check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or
diagnose an illness as well as allow you to recall other important
information about living organisms.

##### Physical Sciences / Survival Skill 

Your Physical Sciences check measures your ability to recall lore about
terrain, the weather, and natural cycles as well as perform mathematical
operations. You might be asked to make a Survival check to navigate and
find a path within a given environment, follow tracks, hunt wild game,
guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears
live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural
hazards. This skill is also used in urban environments to survive on the
streets and to live within that environment.

#### Reasoning Characteristics

**Reasoning** represents the overall ability of the being to adapt and
manipulate the information they get from the world around them

##### Engineering Skill 

Your Engineering check measures your character's ability to apply
technology in order to build, modify, and repair devices. You might also
need an Engineering check to see if you can reverse engineer a Dwarven
chest, repair a broken crossbow, or disarm a trap. Almost every trade,
craft, or occupation that requires someone to build something will be
making a Engineering roll to determine their level of success.

##### Insight Skill 

Your Insight check decides whether you can determine the true intentions
of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's
next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech
habits, and changes in mannerisms.

##### Investigation Skill 

When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues,
you make an Investigation check. You might deduce the location of a
hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of
weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could
cause it to collapse.

#### Acuity Characteristics

**Acuity** represents the overall ability of the being to harmonize
conflicts in their understanding by pushing themselves mentally.

##### Traditions Skill 

##### Perception Skill 

Your character's Perception check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise
detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of
your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you
might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under
an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you
might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they
are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an
alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

##### Formal Sciences Skill 

Your Formal Science skill is used when you are attempting to understand
any formal system such as logic, mathematics, statistics, information
theory, game theory, or decision theory. This skill is also used in
conjunction with another skill when someone wishes to advance the craft
of that other skill formally.

### Social Aspects

#### Convention Characteristics

**Convention** represents the overall ability of the being to socially
understand the world around them

##### Style Skill 

Your style determines how well you can understand the mind of the public
or a given audience to delight them with a dress, a painting, a
sculpture, a poem, or any other form or artistic pursuit that produces
some sort of cultural artifact.

##### Performance Skill 

Your performance check determines how well you can delight an audience
with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of
entertainment.

##### Etiquette Skill 

Your character's ability to say the right thing at the right time to any
person.

#### Personality Characteristics

**Personality** represents the overall ability of the being to conform
their own actions to create the outcomes they want.

##### Deception Skill

A Deception check determines whether you can convincingly hide the
truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can
encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling
outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard,
con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a
disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a
straight face while telling a blatant lie.

##### Persuasion Skill

When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact,
social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Persuasion
check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to
foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette.
Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let
your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or
inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

##### Intimidation Skill

When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile
actions, and physical violence, you might be asked to make a
Intimidation check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a
prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or
using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to
reconsider a decision.

#### Identity Characteristics

**Identity** represents the overall ability of the being to harmonize
conflicts in the society they exist in by pushing themselves socially.

##### Bureaucracy Skill 

Bureaucracy is used when you need to understand the bureaucratic
structures of group and how they can be used to create the outcomes you
need. This can bet how the local politican work, or law enforcement can
be incentivized or the rules of churches or other formalized social
structures of a corporation or social group.

##### Animal Handling Skill 

When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated
animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's
intentions, you might need an Animal Handling check. You also make an
Animal Handling check to control your mount when you attempt a risky
maneuver.

##### Leadership Skill 

Your character's ability to inspire others to become the best versions
of themselves.

### Spirituality Aspects

#### Skepticism Characteristics 

**Skepticism** represents the overall ability of the being to manipulate
the spiritual powers as laws of nature

##### Arcana Skill 

Arcana takes the scientific method and applies it to the spiritual
realm. A Gnostic would focus on understanding the knowledge and theory
of how something worked, while an arcanist would focus on making a
workable system that predicts outcomes. It is skeptical of magic being
personal or aligned to ideals, creatures, or others. It's Math and
Formula. This is the magic of the traditional RPG Mage."

##### Gnosis Skill 

Gnosis is a focus on the spiritual realm that insists that understanding
and knowledge and the abandonment of the physical are the keys to
enlightenment, power, and individual and personal monergism. This is
about the person themselves and achieving enlightenment and escape from
the physical realms. Advanced practitioners may not be fully self
focused. This is the magic of the Guru and the Hermit."

##### Chaos Skill

Chaos magic understands that the universe is unique and every
circumstance needs to be addressed uniquely. Chaosism attempts to
harness the random aspects of a circumstance to the advantage of the
caster. This is the magic of trickster, the bard, and the storm.

#### Faith Characteristics

**Faith** represents the overall ability of the being to trust in the
promises of other beings

##### Theurgy Skill 

This collection of skills is associated with interactions with other
spiritual beings. These are generally rituals and practices that form
the interactions and bargains that are made between those intelligent
creatures that live within the spirit realm and who are capable of
various bargains or contracts. This is traditional Clerical Magic and
warlock magic."

##### Adept Skill

This collection of skills is associated with having an understanding
one's own personal spiritual power and skills. An Adept is someone who
has perfected their understanding of their spiritual strengths and
weaknesses and uses them to enhance their body, mind, and social
interactions. This is the magic of martial arts. It's chief focus is the
caster itself, and not some other ideal or other creature, while a
martial art form may be inspired by some living creature or force of
nature, the goal of the Adept is self improvement and mastery not to
become that creature. "

##### Order Skill 

Order is the study of how the spiritual realms are ordered, predictable,
and outcomes are controlled. This is the magic of the Paladin who is
aligned to dieties or other cosmic powers."

#### Mystery Characteristics 

**Mystery** represents the overall ability of the being to harmonize
conflicts in their understanding of the spiritual realms by pushing
themselves.

##### Metaphysics Skill 

Someone who uses Metaphysics is trying to understand the pathways
through time and space with a focus on knowing the substance, cause, and
identity of the spiritual aspects of reality. This is the magic of the
Oracle, ESP, and Psionics."

##### Animism Skill 

Animism is the understanding that the whole universe itself is imbued
with spiritual power. Someone who uses Animism understands these powers
and uses them to shape the world around them. Some Animists focus on
philosophical ideals such as peace, change, love, honor, etc. and try to
order everything toward increasing that ideal everywhere. Others will
focus on a cosmostological ideals that about the spiritual composition
of matter and attempt to shape and control that. This is the magic of
the Jedi and other non-religiously affiliated paladins. This is the
magic of the artificer and the elemtnalist."

##### Shamanism Skill 

Shamanism is the understanding of and confirming one's own spiritual
strengths and weaknesses to mirror the Physical, Mental, Social, and
Spiritual aspects of other living creatures. This is the magic of the
Druid or the Shaman. This is also the magic of the shapeshifters and
dopelgangers."

## Careers

As a part of their development, characters follow certain life paths
called careers. The Märchen Engine provides a variety of career options
for characters to pursue, which opens up opportunities for characters to
gain skill levels, characteristic boosts and significant mustering out
benefits before they enter into play. See **Chapter 1: Character
Creation** for more information.

## Game Play

Playing a session using the Märchen Engine rules resembles verbally
acting out chapters from a science fiction novel. Game sessions can last
from short sessions of an hour or two, up to marathon games covering
most of a weekend. The average game session tends to run three to five
hours, however. Over the course of a session, the player-characters
pursue their adventures. Some resolve quickly, within a single session,
while others may take place in multiple acts spread out over several
sessions.

Each adventure is like its very own story, consisting of a series of
scenes that are explored during play. In general, most scenes are simply
the players interacting with the non-player characters and the universe
created by the Referee. The players describe their actions, and the
Referee describes the results of those actions, in a back-and-forth
exchange. Certain kinds of situations, such as personal or space combat,
have more structure and more rules to help the players resolve their
actions in ways reflecting the abilities of their characters.

## Themes

### Common Märchen Engine Themes

On-going games using the Märchen Engine rules are generally designed
around a theme. Based in the classic era of science fiction, these rules
lend themselves to games following certain common themes, which are
detailed in the Common Märchen Engine Themes table. This is not a
complete list of the type of games that the Märchen Engine is designed
to handle; this is simply a general list of common themes for
consideration.

#### Table: Common Märchen Engine Themes

| Theme       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Colonial    | The adventurers are on the borders of explored space, helping to select a new world for a colony and then settle it. These campaigns allow a group to develop a single world extensively.                                                                                                                                               |
| Commerce    | The adventurers live aboard a frontier trader or merchant trader, making a living through the transport of freight, passengers, speculative cargo and the occasional odd job. These campaigns heavily explore the trade and commerce rules.                                                                                             |
| Drifter     | The adventurers constantly move from place to place, without any fixed home or job, seeking employment through odd jobs as they explore the universe that the Referee has created. These campaigns are sometimes called "Sandbox Campaigns" because they explore an area that has been previously created and populated by the Referee. |
| Espionage   | The adventurers all belong to the same government or corporate intelligence agency, and make a living by going on spy missions against their enemies. These campaigns tend to be more episodic than other common campaign themes.                                                                                                       |
| Exploration | The adventurers serve aboard a survey vessel, making a living travelling through previously uncharted regions of space, exploring strange new worlds, and seeking out new life and new civilizations as they boldly go where no sophont has gone before. These campaigns make heavy use of the rules for generating worlds.             |
| Mercenary   | The adventurers all belong to the same mercenary unit, making a living by participating in military actions in the hire of an interested party to the conflict. These campaigns make significant use of the personal combat rules, with a particular focus on large-scale military scenarios.                                           |
| Political   | The adventurers are heavily involved in the social and political arena of an interstellar polity, dealing with diplomats, nobles and other factions with vested interests in controlling aspects of the government. These campaigns tend to focus on diplomacy and political intrigue.                                                  |
| Rebellion   | The adventurers are involved in a blossoming civil war, seeking either to preserve or overthrow the current government. These campaigns typically start with intrigue and end with action.                                                                                                                                              |

## Mechanics

### Die Rolls

The Märchen Engine allows play players to pick between several different
dice rolling mechanics. They are as follows:

Using the Märchen Engine, when you have to make a die roll to resolve an
action, it will typically follow the core system of a 2D6 roll plus
modifiers versus a target of 8+ (read as eight or higher). This is
called a check. You always want to roll high on a check. Rolling 12
before adding modifiers (where two sixes appear on the dice naturally)
is not an automatic success, and rolling 2 before adding modifiers
(where both dice show a one naturally) is not an automatic failure.

#### Difficulty and Effect

A check's Difficulty is a number set by the Referee that modifies your
check result. When no Difficulty is given, the assumed Difficulty is +0.
So, for a task with a Difficulty of +2, you must add +2 to the check
result. You succeed on a total of 8 or better. The list of Difficulty
ratings can be found in the Task Difficulty table

##### Table: Task Difficulties

| Difficulty     | DM  |
|----------------|-----|
| Simple         | +6  |
| Easy           | +4  |
| Routine        | +2  |
| Average        | +0  |
| Difficult      | -2  |
| Very Difficult | -4  |
| Formidable     | -6  |

In some cases, the consequences of a check vary based on how much the
check result is above or below the target of 8. The difference between
the check result and the target of 8 is called the Effect. If the Effect
is 6 or higher, the check is considered an Exceptional Success. When the
Effect is -6 or lower, the check is considered an Exceptional Failure.
See **Chapter 2: Skills** for more details.

##### Table: Degrees of Success

| Effect Range | Degree of Success   |
|--------------|---------------------|
| -6 or lower  | Exceptional Failure |
| -1 to -5     | Failure             |
| 0 to +5      | Success             |
| +6 or higher | Exceptional Success |

#### Opposed Checks

If two characters are opposing each other directly in a task, then the
character who obtains the highest Effect wins. For ties on opposed
checks, the character with the highest relevant characteristic score
wins. If the characters tie on characteristic scores, they reroll.

#### Trying Again

In general, you can try a check again if you fail, and keep trying
indefinitely. Some tasks, however, have consequences for failure. For
example, failing an Athletics check while climbing a cliff might mean
you fall, which might make it difficult to try again. Some tasks can't
be attempted again once a check has failed. For most tasks, once you've
succeeded, additional successes are meaningless. (Once you've discovered
a computer account's password using the Computer skill, for instance,
there's no further benefit from additional Computer checks to determine
the account's password.)

#### Circumstance Modifiers

Some circumstances make a check easier or harder, resulting in a bonus
or penalty that is added to the check result. The Referee can alter the
odds of success in two ways:

- If a character has help, such as good tools, competent aids or other
  beneficial circumstances, he receives a +1 bonus to his skill check.

- If a character is hampered, such as having defective tools,
  incompetent assistance or other negative circumstances, he receives a
  -1 penalty to his skill check.

#### Time and Checks

Outside of stressful situations such as combat, performing a particular
task often takes a random amount of time, depending on circumstances.
For most tasks, roll 1D6 and multiply it by the increment that the
Referee provides for that action. For example, breaking a flimsy wooden
door down may only require 1D6 seconds, while performing delicate
surgery might take 1D6 hours. More information on time increments can be
found in **Chapter 2: Skills**.

During combat, most actions are more refined to a finite period. Some of
these actions are considered minor actions, while others are deemed
significant actions. More information is provided in **Chapter 5:
Personal Combat**.

#### Aiding Another

Sometimes characters work together and help each other out. In this
case, one character (usually the one with the highest total of modifiers
on the check) is considered the leader of the effort and makes the check
normally, while each helper makes the same check. The Effect of a
helper's check result can provide either a bonus (DM+1 with a successful
result, DM+2 with an Exceptional Success) or a penalty (DM-1 with a
failed result, DM-2 with an Exceptional Failure) to the leader's check
result. In many cases, outside help isn't beneficial, or only a limited
number of helpers can aid someone at once. The Referee limits aid as
appropriate for the task and conditions.

### Types of Checks

There are two main types of checks: skill checks and characteristic
checks.

#### Skill Checks

A skill check determines what you can accomplish with a particular skill
(sometimes whether you're trained in that skill or not). It is a roll of
2D6, modified by your levels in the skill, the skill's key
characteristic score modifier, and the Difficulty, against a target of 8
or higher. Skill checks sometimes have gradations of success and failure
based on the Effect of your check result (how much higher or lower your
check result is when compared to the target of 8). When making a skill
check, if a character does not have any levels in the required skill,
then he suffers a –3 penalty for being unskilled.

#### Attack Rolls

An attack roll determines whether or not you hit an opponent in combat.
An attack roll is essentially a skill check, using your skill levels in
combat skills as modifiers.

#### Characteristic Checks

A characteristic check is like a skill check, but measures raw ability,
like strength, endurance, or intelligence. These checks are used when
the task is one not covered by an obvious skill, or where the
character’s innate abilities are the most important influence on the
result. To make a Characteristic check, you must roll 2D6 and add the
appropriate characteristic score modifier. Characteristic checks tend to
be all or nothing (you can either accomplish the task or you can't),
although there are sometimes gradations of success or failure.

## The Combat Round

When things really start happening in a Märchen Engine game, time is
broken down into six-second segments called rounds, or combat rounds,
since they're most often used in fights. A round isn't very much time,
just long enough for a character to do something. The types of actions
your character can perform during a round are significant actions, minor
actions, extended actions, free actions, and reactions. During a round
you can do one of the following:

- Initiate or continue an extended action.

- Take a significant action and a minor action.

- Take three minor actions, and forego taking a significant action this
  turn.

You can perform as many free actions and reactions in a round as you
wish, although the Referee may choose to limit them to a reasonable
number to keep the game moving. See **Chapter 5: Personal Combat** for
more information.

## Pseudo-Hexadecimal Notation

The Märchen Engine uses a form of pseudo-hexadecimal notation as a type
of shorthand in noting specific values of characteristic scores, world
statistics, drive type designations and similar design elements. The
pseudo-hexadecimal notation proceeds as normal for values from 0 to 15,
but extends beyond F for 15, with G for 16, etc. The Märchen Engine
skips the use of the letters I and O, because they might be mistaken for
the numbers 1 and 0. The Pseudo-Hexadecimal Notation table provides a
quick reference for converting values for use in Märchen Engine.

#### Table: Pseudo-Hexadecimal Notation

| Actual Value | PseudoHex | Actual Value | PseudoHex | Actual Value | PseudoHex |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **0**        | 0         | **12**       | C         | **24**       | Q         |

## Important Terms

The Märchen Engine uses certain words and abbreviations throughout the
rules system. In order properly understand the Märchen Engine rules,
both players and Referees should become familiar with these terms. The
following words, phrases and abbreviations are commonly used in The
Märchen Engine:

**2D6**: Two six-sided dice, used to resolve all actions in the Märchen
Engine.

**Action**: A character activity. There are significant actions, minor
actions, extended actions, free actions, and reactions.

**Adventure**: A story created by the Referee and players, comprised of
a series of related scenes or encounters.

**Attack bonus**: A modifier used to measure a character's combat skill.

**Attack roll**: A skill check used to determine whether an attack hits.

**Attack**: Any of numerous actions intended to harm, disable, or
neutralize an opponent.

**Bonus**: A positive modifier to a die roll.

**Campaign**: A series of linked adventures.

**Character**: A fictional individual in the game. The players control
characters, while the Referee controls non-player characters.

**Characteristic modifier**: A modifier determined by the value of the
characteristic score, applied as a bonus or penalty to checks as needed.

**Characteristic score**: One of the six basic character traits --
Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Endurance (End), Intelligence (Int),
Education (Edu), and Social Standing (Soc).

**Check (or Throw)**: A method of deciding the result of a character's
action. Checks are based on a relevant ability, skill, or other trait.
To make a check, roll 2D6 and add any relevant modifiers. If the check
result equals or exceeds a target of 8 or the result of an opponent's
check, it succeeds.

**Coreward**: An astrographical term indicating the direction of
Sagittarius A\* (pronounced "Sagittarius A-star", standard abbreviation
Sgr A\*), a bright and very compact astronomical radio source at the
center of the Milky Way galaxy.

**Crown (₢)**: The primary unit of currency used in the Märchen Engine.
For very large amounts of money, the kilocrown (K₢) represents one
thousand crown and the megacrown (M₢) represents one million cowns.

**Critical hit (crit)**: An attack inflicting extra damage. Critical
hits are only involved in vehicular and space combat.

**D66**: A special die roll generated by rolling two six-sided dice of
different colors (or rolling one die twice, noting each number rolled),
multiplying the first die by 10 and then adding the second die, to
create a number between 11 and 66.

**Damage bonus**: A modifier used to determine the damage of an attack.

**Damage**: Harm caused to a character by injury, illness, or some other
source.

**Dice modifier (DM)**: A modifier applied to a check.

**Die (plural is dice)**: A small polyhedron, typically a cube, with
each side having a different number on it, ranging from one to the
number of sides of the polyhedron, thrown and used in gambling and other
games involving chance. The Märchen Engine uses six-sided dice
exclusively to create random results during play.

**Difficulty**: A modifier applied to a check that is assigned by the
Referee, reflecting the relative ease or difficulty of a given action.

**Dominant race**: A sentient species capable of interstellar travel via
jump drive technology, and that has used that technology to expand their
presence over a significant region of space. Dominant Races typically
control a fairly expansive interstellar government, and have settlements
and significant populations more than ten parsecs away from their planet
of origin.

**Dying**: Near death and unconscious. A dying character can take no
actions.

**Effect**: The difference between a check result and the target of 8
(i.e. how much higher or lower the result is).

**Encounter**: An unexpected or casual meeting with someone or
something. A large part of the Referee’s job is the administration of
encounters.

**Explorer's Society**: A private interstellar travel service which
maintains exclusive resorts and facilities at various starports. Several
interstellar organizations provide membership to the Explorer's Society
as a reward for outstanding service.

**Exceptional failure**: Any check that fails by 6 or greater (i.e. has
an Effect of -6 or worse).

**Exceptional success**: Any check that succeeds by 6 or greater (i.e.
has an Effect of +6 or better).

**Extended action**: An action in combat that takes longer than a single
combat round to complete.

**Free action**: An extremely fast activity, requiring very little time
and effort.

**Homeworld**: **1)** The world that serves as a character’s place of
origin, usually the world on which the character was raised and which
had the most impact on their development during their pre-adult life.
**2)** The world of origin for an non-human species, i.e. Earth is the
homeworld for the human species.

**Jump**: A form of faster-than-light movement using Jump drives, which
always takes one week to travel a number of parsecs equal to its Jump
rating and consumes a vast amount of fuel.

**Jump point**: A point in space more than 100 diameters out from any
nearby celestial body, chosen by a navigator as the point from which a
ship will enter into Jump space.

**Jump space**: The alternate dimension through which starships travel
when transitioning from one point in normal space to another.

**Lesser race**: A sentient species that has not developed jump drive
technology on its own. While individuals of the Lesser races can and do
engage in interstellar travel, settled populations of any given Lesser
Race are rarely encountered further than ten parsecs from their
homeworld.

**Lethal damage**: Damage that can potentially disable or kill a target.

**Mainworld**: The primary world of a star system; the world represented
by the UWP in a list of worlds for a given region of space.

**Melee attack**: A physical attack in close combat.

**Melee weapon**: A handheld weapon designed for close combat.

**Minor action**: An action intended to move a distance or to manipulate
or move an object. You can take up to three minor actions per round, at
the loss of a significant action.

**Misjump**: A mishap caused by an inaccurate jump, which results in
jumping to a random location with damage to the vessel and potentially
the crew. Common causes for misjumps include bad Jump plots, damaged
Jump drives, diverting energy into the Jump drive improperly, jumping
from within the hundred-diameter limit and using unrefined fuel.

**Modifier**: Any bonus or penalty applied to a die roll.

**Natural**: A natural result on a roll or check is the actual number
appearing on the die, not the modified result obtained by adding bonuses
or subtracting penalties.

**Non-lethal damage**: Damage that can potentially stun or knock out a
target, but does no permanent harm.

**Non-player character (NPC)**: A character controlled by the Referee
(as opposed to a character controlled by a player).

**Non-starship**: A spaceship without a jump drive, and thus incapable
of interstellar travel on its own.

**Patron**: A non-player character who gives financial or other support
to a person, organization, cause, or activity. Referees often use
patrons as a tool to attempt to engage player characters in adventures.

**Penalty**: A negative modifier to a die roll.

**Player character (PC)**: A character controlled by a player, one of
the protagonists of an adventure or campaign.

**Psion**: A character with psionic abilities.

**Ranged attack**: Any attack made at a distance.

**Ranged weapon**: A projectile or thrown weapon designed for attacking
at a distance.

**Reaction**: An action taken in response to the action of another. You
can perform as many reactions as you want per round in Personal Combat,
but the number of Reactions that a vessel can undertake is based on
Initiviative in Space Combat.

**Referee**: The player who portrays characters not controlled by the
other players, arbitrates the rules, and makes up the story and setting
for the game.

**Rimward**: An astrographical term indicating the direction opposite of
Coreward, or directly away from the radio source of Sagittarius A\*.

**Round**: A six-second unit of game time used to manage actions,
usually in combat.

**Significant action**: An action intended to do something within about
3 seconds. You can perform a single significant action per round, or
forego it to perform a total of three minor actions.

**Seriously wounded**: If you have lost at least one point from all
three of your physical characteristics, you are considered seriously
wounded. When conscious, you cannot move except to hobble or crawl along
at 1.5 meters per combat round. You also lose your minor action in
combat. You can only regain characteristic points equal to your
Endurance DM per day of rest through natural healing. You require
surgery.

**Skill**: An ability to perform a set action, such as navigating a
starship, operating a rifle, or programming a computer. Skills are
attained in levels (Navigation-1, Computer-2, etc); the higher the level
of a skill, the more expertise a character has in that area. Many
different individual skills are available to characters.

**Small Craft**: A vessel under 100 tons, capable of interplanetary
travel.

**Sophont**: A sentient being with a base reasoning capacity roughly
equivalent to or greater than that of an average human being.

**Spinward**: An astrographical term indicating the direction of the

travel on its own.

**Target (also subject)**: The intended recipient of an attack, action,
or effect.

**Trailing**: An astrographical term indicating the direction opposite
of the galaxy's rotation.

**Trained**: Having knowledge of, and therefore levels in, a skill.

untrained. Unskilled skill checks suffer a DM-3 penalty.

**Vessel**: General term used to starships, small craft, or vehicles as
a general inclusive group. Most commonly, it refers to any vehicle or
ship capable of interplanetary or interstellar travel.

**World**: A generic term in the Märchen Engine for any inhabitable
celestial body or similar location represented by a Universal World
Profile.

# BOOK ONE: CHARACTERS

# CHAPTER 1: CHARACTER CREATION

Märchen Engine characters are rarely beginners fresh from the farm.
There is no reason not to play a young and inexperienced character if
you like, but since a broad range of skills is important to success in
the game most players will want their character to be a little more
experienced in the world.

All characters begin at the age of majority, typically 18. Having
generated characteristic scores and background skills, the character
should begin serving terms in his or her chosen career. Each 4-year term
spent in a career gives the character more experience in the universe,
generally in the form of skills. Generate the results of each term
before proceeding to the next. At the end of a period of service,
characters roll for benefits gained upon "mustering out" (i.e. leaving
the service). They may then begin adventuring.

This chapter provides complete instructions for the generation of
twenty-four distinct career paths.

## Character Creation Checklist

## Characteristics

Characteristics measure a character’s most basic abilities: how strong,
dexterous, educated or intelligent he is. Characteristic scores
influence almost everything your character does. Stronger characters can
lift greater weights, more dexterous characters have better balance, and
so forth.

Characters have six abilities: Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex),
Endurance (End), Intelligence (Int), Education (Edu), and Social
Standing (Soc). Strength, Dexterity, and Endurance are called physical
abilities, whereas Intelligence, Education, and Social Standing are
loosely termed mental abilities. Each above-average ability score
provides a bonus on certain die rolls; while below average abilities
apply a penalty to some die rolls.

The six characteristics for your character are briefly described as
follows:

- **Strength** (Str): A character’s physical strength, fitness and
  forcefulness.

- **Dexterity** (Dex): Physical co-ordination and agility, reflexes.

- **Endurance** (End): A character’s ability to sustain damage, stamina
  and determination.

- **Intelligence** (Int): A character’s intellect and quickness of mind.

- **Education** (Edu): A measure of a character’s learning and
  experience.

- **Social Standing** (Soc): A character’s place in society.

### Social Standing and Noble Titles

In a Märchen Engine universe where characters of sufficiently high
Social Standing characteristic scores are considered nobility, specific
values of Social Standing are often associated with specific titles of
nobility. The Titles of Nobility by Social Standing table captures some
examples, but actual values may vary from universe to universe. Versions
of these titles traditionally given to the female gender are provided in
parentheses.

#### Table: Titles of Nobility by Social Standing

| Social Standing | Monthly Costs | Daily Costs | Title of Nobility               | Title – European Style                   | Title – Indian Style | Titles – Japanese style |     |

### ~~Psionic Strength, the Seventh Characteristic~~

~~Within the Märchen Engine, characters can sometimes have a seventh
characteristic score. When a character learns psionics, they generate a
Psionic Strength characteristic (abbreviation Psi), which powers their
psionic talents. This characteristic cannot be rolled or bought during
character creation without the Referee’s permission. For more
information on this topic, see **Chapter 3: Psionics**.~~

### Generating Characteristic Scores

Generating characteristics scores is fairly straightforward. Roll your
six characteristics using 2D6, and record them in the standard order:
Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Endurance (End), Intelligence (Int),
Education (Edu), and Social Standing (Soc).

**Optional Rule**: With the Referee’s approval, roll 2D6 six times, and
assign the results to the six different characteristic scores based on a
particular character concept. For example, if you picture your character
as a highly-educated researcher, then you might assign your highest
result to Education, and assign your second highest to Intelligence.

**Characteristic Score Limits**: For player characters, a characteristic
score may not typically exceed a maximum of 15, nor may a score drop
permanently below 1 except under certain circumstances.

### Characteristic Modifiers

Once you have assigned your characteristic scores, you can determine
your characteristic modifiers. These modifiers are applied to any check
when you do something related to that characteristic. An ability score
modifier is calculated by dividing the ability score by three, dropping
all fractions, and then subtracting one, so that the average
characteristic score of 7 has a DM+0. Thus, a characteristic value of 2
or less has a modifier of DM-2, characteristic values of 3 to 5 have a
modifier of DM-1, and so on. The Characteristic Modifier by Score Range
table provides a synopsis of these modifiers, already calculated for
you.

#### Table: Characteristic Modifier by Score Range

| Score Range   | PseudoHex | Characteristic Modifier |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| 0 through 2   | 0-2       | -2                      |
| 3 through 5   | 3-5       | -1                      |
| 6 through 8   | 6-8       | +0                      |
| 9 through 11  | 9-B       | +1                      |
| 12 through 14 | C-E       | +2                      |
| 15 through 17 | F-H       | +3                      |
| 18 through 20 | J-L       | +4                      |
| 21 through 23 | M-P       | +5                      |
| 24 through 26 | Q-S       | +6                      |
| 27 through 29 | T-V       | +7                      |
| 30 through 32 | W-Y       | +8                      |
| 33 or higher  | Z         | +9                      |

### Altering Characteristic Scores

Over the course of play, your character's characteristic scores may
change for the following reasons:

- Aging can permanently lower physical characteristic scores.

- Physical damage, such as from combat, falling, disease or poison,
  temporarily lowers physical characteristic scores.

- Mental trauma, such as head injuries and psionic attack, temporarily
  lowers mental characteristic scores.

- Certain medications, psionic enhancements, and other scenarios can
  temporarily or permanently enhance specific characteristic scores.

Whenever a characteristic score changes, you will need to determine the
new characteristic modifier.

### On Gender and Race

The core Märchen Engine rules make no distinctions between different
members of the same species, regardless of gender or race. In the realm
of classic science fiction literature, heroes came in many different
flavors and capacities, and were generally unhindered by their gender or
the color of their skin.

Non-Human species may have additional gender choices that can impact a
character’s characteristic scores and grant specific abilities or traits
based on gender selection. For example, if an insectoid species has four
genders (queen, soldier, worker and drone), each might grant different
characteristic bonuses or penalties that impact character creation. The
definition of Non-Human species lies in the realm of the Referee’s
powers of creativity, as befits the nature of their campaign and
universe.

### On Non-Human Species and Social Standing

Non-Human Species may have different criteria for Social Standing: Caste
or Charisma. When dealing with a race that has a different concept of
Social Standing, all DMs from Social Standing or its Non-Human species
equivalent – whether positive or negative – are halved.

### On Non-Human Species Instinct and Pack

Non-Human Species possess STR, DEX, END, and INT characteristics just
like human characters. However, instead of EDU and SOC, they have
Instinct (INS) and Pack (PAC) characteristics.

**Instinct (INS)** is the monstrous equivalent of EDU. Monsters apply
their INS characteristic to tasks such as sensing prey.

**Pack (PAC)** is the animal equivalent of SOC. The higher the
creature's PAC score, the larger the group that it can be associated
with, and the more standing the creature has in that group.

## The Universal Persona Profile (UPP)

The Märchen Engine utilizes a concise format to encapsulate data on an
individual character’s characteristic scores in a manner that, with a
little practice, can be quickly and easily read. The specifics of the
Universal Persona Profile can be found below:

123456, or 123456-7 for psionic characters

### The Explanation

The numbers represent the position of a pseudo-hexadecimal notation of
an individual’s characteristic scores. These scores are, in order:

1.  **Strength** (Str)

2.  **Dexterity** (Dex)

3.  **Endurance** (End)

4.  **Intelligence** (Int)

5.  **Education** (Edu)

6.  **Social Standing** (Soc)

7.  **Psionic Strength** (Psi)

For example, if a character has the following characteristic scores:

Strength 6, Dexterity 8, Endurance 7, Intelligence 11, Education 9,
Social Standing 12

Then the character’s UPP would be 687B9C. If the character later tested
for Psionics, and ended up with a Psionic Strength of 4, the UPP would
then become 687B9C-4.

## Universal Character Format

The following format is used to represent a character’s basic game
statistics in the Märchen Engine rules.

\[Character Name, with rank and/or noble title, if appropriate\]
\[Character UPP\] Age \[Character Age\]

\[Character Careers, with terms listed in parentheses\] Cr\[Character
Funds\]

\[Character Skill List, in alphabetical order, with skill levels listed
after skill names\]

\[Species Traits, if not human; optional\]

\[Character Equipment, if available; list only significant property\]

Here is an example of a system-wide human celebrity that has been
entertaining his holovid fans for almost two decades with his heroic
action movies:

Bruce Ayala 786A9A Age 38

Entertainer (5 terms) ₢70,000

Athletics-1, Admin-1, Advocate-1, Bribery-1, Carousing-3, Computer-2,
Gambling-0, Grav Vehicle-0, Liaison-2, Linguistics-0, Streetwise-0

High passage (x2)

## Background Skills

Before embarking on your careers, you get a number of background skills
equal to 3 + your Education DM (1 to 5, depending on your Education
score).

### Homeworld Skills

Growing up on your homeworld gave you skills that depend on the planet’s
nature. You can select any skill that matches your homeworld’s planetary
description and trade codes. If you came from a planet already
established in the Referee’s universe, then consult those sources for
the planet’s description.

#### Table: Homeworld Skills by Planetary Description

| Descriptor | Skill          |
|------------|----------------|
| No Law     | Gun Combat-0   |
| Low Law    | Gun Combat-0   |
| Medium Law | Gun Combat-0   |
| High Law   | Melee Combat-0 |

#### Table: Homeworld Skills by Trade Code

| Trade Code      | Skill        |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Agricultural    | Animals-0    |
| Asteroid        | Zero-G-0     |
| Desert          | Survival-0   |
| Fluid Oceans    | Watercraft-0 |
| Garden          | Animals-0    |
| High Technology | Computer-0   |
| High Population | Streetwise-0 |
| Ice-Capped      | Zero-G-0     |
| Industrial      | Broker-0     |
| Low Technology  | Survival-0   |
| Poor            | Animals-0    |
| Rich            | Carousing-0  |
| Water World     | Watercraft-0 |
| Vacuum          | Zero-G-0     |

### Primary Education Skills

A formal education gives you a basic level of competence in various
sciences and academic disciplines. Any character may choose from the
following list:

> Admin-0, Advocate-0, Animals-0, Carousing-0, Comms-0, Computer-0,
> Electronics-0, Engineering-0, Life Sciences-0, Linguistics-0,
> Mechanics-0, Medicine-0, Physical Sciences-0, Social Sciences-0, Space
> Sciences-0.

## Careers

Characters in the Märchen Engine do not start at the age of majority and
jump immediately into play with only their background skills. Instead,
characters gain experience by pursuing one of twenty-four different
careers. The random nature of career paths (also known as prior history
or prior careers) leads to characters of all levels of experience, and
from all walks of life. A character gains more skills the longer they
stay in character creation, but not without risk of aging. Player
choices will have great impact on the final disposition of a character.

At many points during a career, a character will have to make a throw of
some sort. Most of these throws are characteristic throws – roll 2D6,
add the DM from the listed characteristic, and try to get a total higher
than the listed value. A throw of Int 8+ means ‘roll 2D6, add your
Intelligence DM, and you succeed if you roll an 8 or more’. A few throws
are skill checks, where you add any levels in that skill and the DM from
an appropriate characteristic, if specified. For example, a throw of
Gambling 8+ would mean ‘roll 2D6, add your Gambling skill and the DM
from an appropriate characteristic such as Dexterity, if specified, and
get over 8’.

### Career Descriptions

The following twenty-four career paths are detailed at the end of this
chapter:

- **Aerospace System Defense**: Member of a planetary armed military
  force operating within a world's atmosphere and close orbit. Also

### Qualifying and the Draft

The Qualification check determines if you can successfully enter into
your chosen career. Military careers use Enlistment as the description
for this roll instead of qualification. If you fail this check then you
cannot enter your chosen career this term. You must either submit to the
Draft or take the Drifter career for this term. You suffer a DM–2 to
qualification rolls for each previous career you have entered. Once you
leave a career you cannot return to it. The Draft and the Drifter career
are exceptions to this rule – you can be Drafted into a career you were
previously in but got ejected from, and the Drifter career is always
open.

#### Table: The Draft

| Roll | Draft Career                                   |
|------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Aerospace System Defense (Planetary Air Force) |
| 2    | Marine                                         |
| 3    | Maritime System Defense (Planetary Navy)       |
| 4    | Navy                                           |
| 5    | Scout                                          |
| 6    | Surface System Defense (Planetary Army)        |

## Terms of Service

Each step through the cycle of resolving your career path, you will go
through a term of service that lasts approximately four years long. This
adds four years to the character’s age. Each time the character
reenlists, or enters into a new career, it is for another term, or four
additional years of service.

## Basic Training

On the first term of a new career, you gain Basic Training as you learn
the basics for your chosen career. For your first career only, you get
all the skills listed in the Service Skills table at Level 0 as your
basic training. For any subsequent careers, you may pick any one skill
listed in the Service Skills table at Level 0 as your basic training.

## Survival

Each career has a survival roll. If you fail this roll, your character
is dead, and you must create a new one. A natural 2 is always a failure.

**Optional Rule**: With the Referee’s approval, you can keep the
character that fails a survival roll and roll on the Survival Mishaps
table instead. This mishap is always enough to force you to leave the
service after half a term, or two years of service. You lose the benefit
roll for the current term only.

#### Table: Survival Mishaps

| 1D6 | Mishap                                                                                                                                               |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Injured in action. (This is the same as a result of 2 on the Injury table.) Alternatively, roll twice on the Injury table and take the lower result. |
| 2   | Honorably discharged from the service.                                                                                                               |
| 3   | Honorably discharged from the service after a long legal battle. Legal issues create a debt of ₢10,000.                                              |
| 4   | Dishonorably discharged from the service. Lose all benefits.                                                                                         |
| 5   | Dishonorably discharged from the service after serving an extra 4 years in prison for a crime. Lose all benefits.                                    |
| 6   | Medically discharged from the service. Roll on the Injury table.                                                                                     |

## Commission and Advancement

Within military careers, a Commission check represents an opportunity to
join the ranks of the commissioned officers. In non-military careers,
the Commission check represents an opportunity to gain a position within
the hierarchy common to your chosen career. Some careers do not have an
established hierarchy, as such, and so do not offer Commission checks. A
character that succeeds at a Commission roll becomes a Rank 1 officer in
that career, and uses the officer Rank table from then on. In addition,
you gain an extra roll on any of the Skills and Training Tables for this
career. A character may attempt a Commission roll once per term, and
trying for commission is optional. A draftee may not attempt a
Commission check in the first term of service.

Each career that has a commission check also has an Advancement roll,
representing your character’s ability to advance with the ranks of your
chosen career’s hierarchy. If you are Rank 1 or higher, you may attempt
an Advancement roll each term. If you are successful, then you move to
the next rank and gain an extra roll on any of the Skills and Training
Tables for this career. You also get any benefits listed for your new
rank. You may only attempt to advance once per term, and you may attempt
to advance in the same term in which you are commissioned.

Commissions and advancement are not available in the Athlete, Barbarian,
Belter, Drifter, Entertainer, Hunter and Scout careers.

## Skills and Training

Each career has skill tables associated with it – Personal Development,
Service Skills, Specialist Skills and Advanced Education. In each term
you spend in a career, pick one of these tables and roll 1D6 to see
which skill you increase. You may only roll on the Advanced Education
table if your character has Education 8+.

Because the Athlete, Barbarian, Belter, Drifter, Entertainer, Hunter and
Scout careers do not have commission or advancement checks, characters
get to make two rolls for skills instead of one every term.

### Cascade Skills

Some skills are "cascade skills" meaning that they have specializations
– specialized forms of that skill. When a cascade skill is selected, the
character must immediately decide on a specialization. Each cascade
skill will list one or more specializations that may be chosen from.
Upon taking a level in a cascade skill specialization, all other
specializations of that skill without skill levels are treated as
Zero-level skills. A character may have multiple specializations in a
skill, such as Natural Weapons-2 and Slashing Weapons-1, under Melee
Combat.

## Injuries

Characters that are wounded in combat or accidents during character
creation must roll on the Injury table.

#### Table: Injury Table

| 1D6 | Injury                                                                                                                           |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Nearly killed. Reduce one physical characteristic by 1D6, reduce both other physical characteristics by 2 (or one of them by 4). |
| 2   | Severely injured. Reduce one physical characteristic by 1D6.                                                                     |
| 3   | Missing eye or limb. Reduce Strength or Dexterity by 2.                                                                          |
| 4   | Scarred. You are scarred and injured. Reduce any one physical characteristic by 2.                                               |
| 5   | Injured. Reduce any physical characteristic by 1.                                                                                |
| 6   | Lightly injured. No permanent effect.                                                                                            |

### Injury Crisis

If any characteristic is reduced to 0, then the character suffers an
injury crisis. The character dies unless he can pay 1D6x10,000 Crowns
for medical care, which will bring any characteristics back up to 1. The
character automatically fails any Qualification checks from now on – he
must either continue in the career he is in or become a Drifter if he
wishes to take any more terms.

### Medical Care

If your character has been injured, then medical care may be able to
undo the effects of damage. The restoration of a lost characteristic
costs ₢5,000 per point.

If your character was injured in the service of a patron or
organization, then a portion of his medical care may be paid for by that
patron. Roll 2D6 on the table below, adding your Rank as a DM. The
result is how much of his medical care is paid for by his employer.

### Medical Debt

During finishing touches, you must pay any outstanding costs from
medical care or anagathic drugs out of your Benefits before anything
else.

## Aging

The effects of aging begin when a character reaches 34 years of age. At
the end of the fourth term, and at the end of every term thereafter, the
character must roll 2D6 on the Aging Table. Apply the character’s total
number of terms as a negative Dice Modifier on this table.

#### Table: Aging Table

| 2D6 | Effects of Aging                                                                  |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| –6  | Reduce three physical characteristics by 2, reduce one mental characteristic by 1 |
| –5  | Reduce three physical characteristics by 2.                                       |
| –4  | Reduce two physical characteristics by 2, reduce one physical characteristic by 1 |
| –3  | Reduce one physical characteristic by 2, reduce two physical characteristic by 1  |
| –2  | Reduce three physical characteristics by 1                                        |
| –1  | Reduce two physical characteristics by 1                                          |
| 0   | Reduce one physical characteristic by 1                                           |
| 1+  | No effect                                                                         |

### Aging Crisis

If any characteristic is reduced to 0 by aging, then the character
suffers an aging crisis. The character dies unless he can pay 1D6x10,000
Crowns for medical care, which will bring any characteristics back up
to 1. The character automatically fails any Qualification checks from
now on – he must either continue in the career he is in or become a
Drifter if he wishes to take any more terms.

### Anagathics

While using anagathic drugs, the character effectively does not age –
add the number of terms since the character started taking anagathics as
a positive Dice Modifier to rolls on the aging table. If a character
stops taking anagathics, then he must roll immediately on the aging
table to simulate the shock that comes from his system beginning to age
again.

The risk of trying to obtain a reliable supply and the disruption to the
character’s biochemistry means the character must make a second Survival
check if he passes his first Survival check in a term. If either check
is failed, the character suffers a mishap and is ejected from the
career.

The drugs cost 1D6x2,500 Crowns for each term that the character uses
the drugs. These costs are paid out of the character’s eventual
mustering-out cash benefits. If the character cannot pay these bills, he
goes into debt.

## Reenlistment and Retirement

At the end of each term, the character must decide that they wish to
continue on their career path or if they wish to muster out. If
continuation is desired, the character must make a successful
Reenlistment check as listed for their current profession or service. If
the character rolls a natural 12, they cannot leave their current career
and must continue for another term. If the check is not successful, then
they cannot reenlist and the character must leave their current career.

A character that has served 7 or more terms in character creation must
retire and cannot undertake any more prior experience, unless they roll
a natural 12 during Reenlistment and must serve another term of service.

**Optional Rule**: The Referee may want to change the maximum number of
terms spent in character creation from 7 to something else. For example,
the Referee may feel that characters built up to a maximum of 3 or even
4 terms are in the prime of their life, but not so experienced that they
won’t take up adventuring opportunities as they are presented.

**Optional Rule**: In some universes, the Referee may elect to totally
remove the maximum number of terms spent in character creation.

A character who has served 5 or more terms in a single service receives
a yearly retirement pension, even if he or she later becomes an
adventurer.

#### Table: Retirement Pay by Terms Served

| Terms | Annual Retirement Pay     |
|-------|---------------------------|
| 5     | ₢10,000                   |
| 6     | ₢12,000                   |
| 7     | ₢14,000                   |
| 8     | ₢16,000                   |
| 9+    | +₢2,000 per term beyond 8 |

## Mustering Out Benefits

Characters who end their careers receive one benefit per term served in
which they did not lose benefits. An additional benefit is gained if the
character held rank O4, and two for rank O5. A character with rank O6
gains three extra benefits.

### Cash Benefits

Up to 3 benefit rolls can be taken on the Cash table. All others must be
taken in material benefits. Characters with Gambling skill or who have
retired gain +1 on Cash Benefit rolls.

### Material Benefits

Material benefits may be characteristics alterations, passages or ship
shares. Membership in the Explorers' Society is possible, and subsequent
receipts of weapon benefits may be taken as skill levels instead. Note
that characters of rank O5 or O6 gain +1 on Material Benefit rolls.

- **Courier Vessel**: The character considered to be on detached duty
  with the scout exploration service, and has been granted the use of a
  surplus 100-ton TL9 Courier starship on a reserve basis. The scout
  exploration service also provides free maintenance and fuel at any
  scout base. All other ship expenses are the responsibility of the
  character. While the character is at liberty to use the vessel as they
  see fit, the vessel still belongs to the scout exploration service,
  and thus cannot be abandoned or sold without consequences. In exchange
  for the use of the ship, the character and the ship are both
  considered to be available to return to active duty at a moment's
  notice, should the scout exploration service have need.

- **Explorers' Society**: The character is a member of the prestigious
  Explorers' Society. The Explorers' Society will provide members with a
  free high passage ticket every two months, plus access to the
  Society's information network and Society-run resorts. This benefit
  can only be received once; any further receipt of this has no
  additional benefit. After character creation, characters may purchase
  membership into the Explorers’ Society. A successful application for
  lifetime membership requires a Routine (-2) Admin check modified by
  the character’s Social Standing, and if accepted, a payment of
  ₢1,000,000. Failure on the application process indicates the character
  has been black listed. If a character has been black listed, the
  Explorers’ Society will no longer accept membership applications from
  them. Membership is non-refundable and non-transferrable.

- **Passage**: The character has a single ticket of the type named (low,
  mid, high) for travel on a starship. It is good for one Jump to any
  destination.

- **Research Vessel**: A scientific foundation, an interstellar
  corporation or some other equally affluent patron has granted the
  character the use of a 200-ton TL9 Research Vessel. All ship expenses,
  other than annual maintenance, are the responsibility of the
  character. This ship still belongs to the patron, and therefore cannot
  be sold or abandoned without consequences.

- **Ship Shares**: Ship shares may be received as benefits. Each ship
  share is worth approximately ₢2,000,000 toward the purchase of a
  vessel. A starship can be purchased for one-fifth of its base value
  with a 40-year loan attached to it. For every one-fifth of its base
  value that is paid to the bank in either ship shares or cash, the
  period of the loan is reduced by ten years. Ship shares may not be
  redeemed for cash.

- **Weapon**: The character leaves the service with an appropriate
  weapon (gun or blade). Once a weapon is taken as a benefit, additional
  receipts of the weapon may be taken as skill in that weapon instead.
  An individual is always free to take additional physical examples of
  the weapons instead of skill levels, if so desired.

## Final Details

It takes more than a set of characteristic scores and skill levels to
create a fun character. By adding some final details at the end of
character creation, you might find the experience of playing the
character far more rewarding.

### Name

At the very least, every character needs a name, preferably one that
fits the style of your gaming group and the Referee’s universe. Consider
choosing a name based on actual “real world” names, on fictional
characters or one you’ve simply made up entirely. If you are stuck, try
choosing two of your favorite science fiction characters, and taking
parts of each of their names to create a unique name for your character.

### Gender

In most games, that means choosing either male or female, but some
Referees or universes may offer other options. There’s nothing that says
you have to play a character of your own gender. Many consider it a
roleplaying challenge to try to portray a different gender in a
realistic manner.

### Appearance

Choosing details such as your character’s height, weight, hair color,
wardrobe preferences and so forth make it easier to describe your
character, which helps everyone visualize your character in their minds
as they play. Distinctive features often give your character a way of
standing out.

### Personal Goals

Time and experience has shown that characters with personal goals are
far more rewarding to play in the long run. A personal goal should be
something that takes more than a single adventure to resolve. Good
examples might include learning the secrets of ancient civilizations,
mastering the psionic arts, or securing political power. Personal goals
often provide the Referee with an opportunity to develop story arcs
based on that character, because the goals inform the Referee about what
the character (and presumably the player) is interested in pursuing.
It’s okay if the character’s goals change over time. In fact, that’s a
great sign of character growth and development.

# CHAPTER 2: ON NON-HUMAN SPECIES

Humans are assumed to be the standard species defined in these rules,
and thus have no special abilities or disadvantages to distinguish
themselves as a species from the basic rules assumptions for characters.

The definition of non-human species lies in the realm of the Referee’s
powers of creativity, as befits the nature of their campaign and
universe. This System Reference Document offers the following examples
of non-human species in an effort to demonstrate common archetypes found
in many forms of classic science fiction. Some universes only have
humans, while others have hundreds of non-human species that characters
can encounter. Your Referee is the final arbiter on whether these or any
other non-human species are present in your campaign.

## Non-Human Species Types

Non-humans come in various types – from humanoids to beasts to undead.
The type determines how various spells affect the monster, as well as
its behavior as you will see below.

**Beasts** are animals, fungi, and plants – both mundane and fantastic.
They have an ecological niche, reproduce, and behave as their ecological
niche dictates. Most beasts are non-sentient or semi-sentient (INT 0
or 1) but in a fantasy world, sentient animals are always a possibility.
Beasts are the most common type of Non-Human Species. Note that
non-humanoid plant and fungal monsters are also considered beasts.
Affected by any spell which affects animals.

**Constructs** are artificial beings – created by magic or technology.
They are usually non-sentient. Immune to mind-affecting spells, poison,
and disease. **Humanoids** resemble human beings, at least in general
terms; they have bilateral symmetry, two arms, two legs, and usually
walk upright. Humanoids are sentient. Generally speaking, affected by
any spell which will affect a human being.

**Outsiders** come from other planes of existence – such as the depth of
Hell, the Elemental Spheres, or far more alien realms. They may or may
not be sentient. Affected, among other things, by Protection from Chaos
spells.

**Undead** are once-living creatures animated by some form of high end
technology or spiritual or supernatural forces. Immune to mind-affecting
spells, poison, and disease.

Note that, unless noted otherwise, all Non-Human Species have at least
Athletics-0 and Melee Combat-0 and all Beasts also have at least
Survival-0.

### Beast Subtypes

Beasts are living animals and thus have ecological niches, or subtypes,
as described below.

#### Carnivores

*Chasers* (such as wolves or velociraptors) chase and exhaust their prey
before killing it.

*Killers* (such as sharks) possess a raw killing instinct and attack
their prey in a frenzy.

*Pouncers* (such as cats) kill by stalking and ambushing their prey.

*Sirens* (such as the venus fly trap) lure their prey to them.

*Trappers* (such as spiders) catch their prey by setting traps.

#### Herbivores

*Filters* (such as earthworms and blue whales) pass the environment
through their bodies. Unlike grazers, which move to food, filters move a
flow of matter through themselves and filter out the food.

*Grazers* (such as antelopes) are herbivores devoting most of their time
to eating.

*Intermittents* (such as elephants) are herbivores that do not devote
all their time to eating.

#### Omnivores

*Eaters* (such as army ants) eat anything and everything – including
characters, if the Eaters can overcome them.

*Gatherers* (such as raccoons and chimpanzees) are omnivores that tend
towards being herbivores.

*Hunters* (such as baboons) are omnivores that tend towards the
carnivorous end of the diet spectrum.

#### Scavengers

*Carrion-Eaters* (such as vultures) wait until all other threats, such
as predators or more aggressive scavengers, leave a carcass before
feasting on it. Scavengers are either carnivores or omnivores.

*Hijackers* (such as lions and *Tyrannosaurus rex*) are scavengers who
steal other predators’ kills by brute force.

*Intimidators* (such as coyotes) establish their claim to food by
intimidating other creatures.

*Reducers* (such as vermin) act constantly on all available food, even
the remains left behind by other scavengers.

### Generic Non-Human Species

Below is a list of generic Non-Human Species that are commonly found in
many forms of fiction. They are reproduced here in order to help the
Referee to come up with something quickly

#### Avians

Descended from Omnivore/Hunter flyers, Avians are a small winged
sentient race capable of flight on smaller worlds. Avians are a
homeothermic, bi-gendered species averaging 1.2 meters in height with a
wingspan over 2.5 meters long from wingtip to wingtip, and have a
typical mass of around 35 kilograms. The natural aptitude of the Avian
race toward exceptional spatial awareness, both conceptually and
physically, immediately lends itself to Piloting and Navigation.

##### Game Mechanics

Avians have Weak Strength (1D6), Notable Dexterity (3D6) and Weak
Endurance (1D6). Avians also have the Flyer (9m), Low Gravity
Adaptation, Natural Pilot, Slow Speed (4.5m) and Small traits. This
winged race reaches maturity at 22, starts aging at 46, stands
105+(2D6x2) centimeters tall, and have a mass of 20+(2D6x2) kilograms.

#### Espers

Espers are humans or near-human humanoids that have embraced the
commonplace usage of psionics. Espers tend to be tall and slender in
build, and their aloof and detached nature makes them inscrutable to
other humans not of their culture. As a race, they have a tendency to be
more mystical or philosophical than other species.

##### Game Mechanics

Espers follow the standard rules for human characters. In addition,
Espers possess the Psionic trait.

#### Insectans

Descended from Carnivore/Chaser stock, the Insectans are an insectoid
race that is hard for most other races to understand. Averaging 1.8
meters in height, and massing around 90 kilograms, the poikilothermic
Insectans are very community-conscious, putting the needs of the
“colony” before the needs of the individual. They have a very limited
ability of individual identity, and more often consider themselves as an
extension of the “queen.” With improved nutrition impacting
intelligence, as well as exposure to other cultures, a growing minority
of Insectans have begun to establish a stronger sense of a personal
Self, but remain heavily influenced by their communal instincts.
Insectans often serve the greater whole of interstellar society in
service-oriented roles, depending on their particular gender, those
being “worker” (sterile female), “soldier” (sterile female), “drone”
(fertile male), or “queen” (fertile female). While there is little in
the way of gross anatomical differences between the genders, carapace
coloration and bearing help non-Insectans distinguish one from another.

##### Game Mechanics

Insectans have Notable Dexterity (2D6+2). Insectans also have the
Armored, Bad First Impression, Caste, Cold-blooded, Fast Speed (9m),
Great Leaper and Hive Mentality traits. Insectans reach maturity at 18
and start aging at 34 (much like humans), stand 160+(2D6x5) centimeters
tall, and have a mass of 60+(2D6x5) kilograms.

NOTE: Insectans have a different characteristic score called Caste,
which replaces Social Standing. Caste is generated in the same manner as
Social Standing. All modifications to Social Standing referenced in the
character creation process impacts Caste equally.

#### Merfolk

Genetically manipulated from pure human stock to life on a waterworld,
Merfolk bear less and less resemblance with their genetic ancestors with
each passing generation. The changes in skin coloration toward pale
greens and blues, combined with the presence of their gills, webbed
appendages and a thin layer of protective blubber give the Merfolk a
somewhat amphibian appearance.

##### Game Mechanics

Merfolk possess the Amphibious, Aquatic, Natural Swimmer and Water
Dependent Non-Human Species traits.

#### Reptilians

Bearing a strong saurian appearance, the Reptilians descend from
homeothermic carnivorous chaser stock. Their scales tend to be
brilliantly patterned, particularly among the males of the species.
Standing approximately 1.9 meters tall, with a mass of 85 kilograms, the
Reptilians still bear many of the features of their saurian ancestors.
Reptilians are driven by a strong sense of territoriality and a primal
need to hunt. After discovering Jump Drive, the Reptilians found
themselves with entire new worlds to claim.

##### Game Mechanics

Reptilians have Notable Strength (2D6+1), Notable Dexterity (2d+1) and
Weak Endurance (2D6-2). Reptilians also possess the Anti-Psionic, Fast
Speed (9m), Heat Endurance, Low-Light Vision, Natural Weapon (teeth) and
Low Gravity Adaptation traits. Reptilians reach maturity at 22, start
aging at 42, stand 155+(2D6x5) centimeters tall, and have a mass of
50+(2D6x5) kilograms.

### Non-Human Species Trait Descriptions

> Below is a list of Non-Human Species traits referred to within this
> document as Non-Human Species traits. Referees are not limited to the
> Non-Human Species traits listed below, but are encouraged to use the
> following as guidelines in creating their own.

- **Acid Resistance**: Members of this species take half damage from
  acid–based effects.

- **Acid Vulnerability**: Members of this species are vulnerable to acid
  damage. Characters take half again as much (+50%) damage as normal
  from such effects.

- **Acute Hearing**: Members of this species possess excellent hearing,
  and receive a +2 DM on any perception–based skill checks dependent on
  hearing.

- **Acute Vision**: Members of this species possess excellent vision,
  and receive a +2 DM on any perception–based skill checks dependent on
  sight.

- **Alertness**: Members of this species are keenly aware of their
  surroundings, and gain a +2 DM on any perception–based skill check.

- **Altitude Adaptation**: Members of this species are adapted to life
  at high altitudes, and thus don't suffer altitude sickness. They are
  always considered acclimated to high altitudes.

- **Amphibious**: A member of this species is adapted to life underwater
  as well as on land. It can breathe underwater, or hold its breath for
  a long period (Endurance x 10 minutes on average). Its Dexterity is
  halved on land.

- **Anosmic**: Members of this species lack sensory organs capable of
  scent or taste, and are thus unable to smell or taste the world around
  them. All checks and activities that rely on scent or taste (such as
  smelling a gas leak or tasting a poison mixed in with food)
  automatically fail. An anosmic character can never gain the scent
  Non-Human Species trait.

- **Anti–Psionic**: Members of this species are innately anti–psionic.
  The character's Psionic Strength rating always equals zero, and they
  cannot be trained in psionics. In addition, the character cannot
  suffer the mental effects of psionics, including telepathy and psionic
  assault. A species cannot have this Non-Human species trait if they
  already have the Psionic, Resistant to Psionics, Telepathy or Limited
  Telepathy Non-Human species traits.

- **Aquatic**: A member of this species is adapted to life underwater.
  It can breathe underwater, or hold its breath for a long period
  (Endurance x 10 minutes on average). It cannot operate out of water
  without mechanical aid or telepresence.

- **Aquatic**: The Non-Human species is adapted to life underwater. It
  can breathe underwater, or hold its breath for a long period
  (Endurancex10 minutes on average). If amphibious, its Dexterity is
  halved on land. If the species is not amphibious, then it cannot
  operate out of water without mechanical aid or telepresence.

- **Armoured**: Members of this species possess thick fur, scales, a
  bony exoskeleton or other natural protection that gives it one point
  of natural armour.

- **Athletic**: Members of this species very athletic, and gain a +2 DM
  on any Athletics skill check.

- **Atmospheric Requirements**: Members of this species cannot survive
  without their native atmosphere. If exposed to another atmosphere
  without the proper life support, characters suffer the usual effects
  of suffocation, in addition to any other effects listed in the
  description of the planetary atmosphere.

- **Bad First Impression**: Members of this species possess an almost
  universally unpleasant appearance or physical trait that invokes an
  instinctive reaction in races other than their own. Most races will
  automatically have an Unfriendly attitude towards these characters,
  although this is overcome after an individual has interacted with the
  character for a few minutes, based on the character’s personality and
  the circumstances of their interaction.

- **Blind–Fighter**: Sensitive sensory organs give members of this
  species the ability to half any penalties due to darkness.

- **Blind**: Members of this species lack sensory organs capable of
  sight, and are thus unable to see the world around them. The character
  suffers a –4 DM on any defensive action that relies on vision, but
  unlike blinded characters, members of this species do not suffer any
  penalties to movement or Strength– or Dexterity–based skill checks.
  All checks and activities that rely on vision automatically fail. All
  opponents are considered to have total concealment to the blind
  character.

- **Blindsight**: Members of this species possess the extraordinary
  ability to use a non–visual sense (or a combination of such senses) to
  operate effectively without vision. Such sense may include sensitivity
  to vibrations, acute scent, keen hearing, or echolocation. This
  ability makes concealment irrelevant to the creature. This ability
  typically operates out to six squares. Blindsight never allows a
  creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A creature cannot
  read with blindsight. Blinding attacks do not penalize creatures using
  blindsight. However, deafening attacks thwart blindsight if it relies
  on hearing. Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.

- **Burst of Speed**: Members of this species are capable of short
  bursts of speed. In combat, the character's base speed is considered
  to be 1.5 times normal. The character cannot maintain this level of
  speed for more than a number of minutes equal to their Endurance score
  without becoming fatigued.

- **Caste**: Members of this species have a genetic or biological
  predisposition towards a social hierarchy. All ability scores and
  skills related to Social understanding instead relate to that
  individuals Social Standing. When dealing with races that are not
  caste based, all social attribute DMs, whether positive or negative,
  are halved. When dealing aith members of a race with a different
  social hiearchy / caste individuals must spend time determining each
  of their places within each other's culture prior to interacting
  without penalties, otherwise they interact as if they are interacting
  with someone outside of a caste system

- **Charisma**: Members of this species are inclined toward a small
  group hierarchy, and therefore have a Charisma ability score instead
  of a Social Standing ability score.

- **Closed Book**: Members of this species are difficult to "read" by
  other races, who suffer a –2 DM on all skills attempting to understand
  the character's reactions or emotions.

- **Cold Endurance**: Members of this species are more comfortable in
  colder environments. When exposed to extreme cold, the character
  suffers –1d6 damage less than normal.

- **Cold Resistance**: Members of this species take half damage from
  cold–based effects.

- **Cold Vulnerability**: Members of this species are vulnerable to cold
  damage. Characters take half again as much (+50%) damage as normal
  from such effects.

- **Cold–Blooded**: Members of this species are sensitive to cold
  climates. If exposed to extreme cold without protective equipment, the
  character suffers a –2 DM to initiative. The character suffers 1d6
  damager for every ten minutes of exposure.

- **Color Blindness**: Members of this species can see in black and
  white only, but their vision is otherwise like normal sight. Skill
  checks involving the use of color automatically fail.

- **Constrict**: Non-Human species with this special attack can crush an
  opponent, dealing typical unarmed damage, after successfully grappling
  a foe.

- **Darkvision**: Members of this species can see in the dark up to 9
  meters (6 squares). Darkvision is black and white only, but it is
  otherwise like normal sight, and characters with darkvision can
  function with no light at all.

- **Deaf:** Members of this species lack sensory organs capable of
  hearing, and are thus unable to hear the world around them. They
  automatically fail checks that require hearing, and suffer a –2 DM on
  any action that is aided by hearing.

- **Deep Diver**: Members of this race can dive in water down to depths
  of 240 meters without artificial aid. In addition, they possess an
  extended lung capacity, and can hold their breath for a number of
  minutes equal to their Endurance score. Despite the fact that this
  species breathes air instead of water, it cannot survive out of water
  unless it also has the Amphibious Non-Human species trait.

- **Desert Adaptation**: Members of this species gain a +2 DM on any
  survival or wilderness–based skill checks made in a desert
  environment, due to growing up on a desert world.

- **Eidetic Memory**: Members of this species gain a +2 DM on recalling
  anything they have directly witnessed. Being able to remember seeing
  something written down (such as flipping through a book or scanning a
  thousand lines of code in seconds) does not immediately grant
  comprehension of the printed word, so the Referee may elect to lower
  or eliminate this bonus in situations that require comprehension
  rather than recollection.

- **Electricity Resistance**: Members of this species take half damage
  from electricity–based effects.

- **Electricity Vulnerability**: Members of this species are vulnerable
  to electricity damage. Characters take half again as much (+50%)
  damage as normal from such effects.

- **Engineered**: The species has been altered by some external factor
  to adapt to changed circumstances or a different environment. Medical
  treatment of Engineered species by a facility of a lower Technology
  Level than that at which the species was created receives a negative
  DM equal to the difference.

- **Entangle**: Members of this species gain a special attack similar to
  a constriction attack (see Constrict above), but an entangle attack
  does not cause damage. Instead, it immobilizes the target while the
  grapple is being held.

- **Fast Healing**: An injured member of this species regains an
  additional 1d6 characteristic points per day through natural healing.

- **Fast Metabolism**: Creatures with a fast metabolism require more
  food than most species, and their life support costs are doubled. In
  combat, fast–metabolism creatures gain a +2 initiative DM.
  Fast–metabolism creatures halve their Endurance for the purposes of
  determining fatigue.

- **Fast Speed**: Species with this Non-Human species trait move at
  speeds greater than that of normal humans.

- **Fast Talker**: Members of this species can easily influence others,
  and gain a +2 DM on any Persuade skill check.

- **Feral**: Feral species are uncivilized, regardless of their
  technological knowledge. Feral species roll Education on 1d6 only.

- **Flyer**: The species can fly using wings, glider membranes, gasbags
  or other means. Characters of this species gain the Athletics (flying)
  skill at Level 0 and can travel at a speed noted in their description.
  Flying creatures who are aloft must spend one minor action every round
  on movement or stall and fall out of the air. Species that float using
  gasbags or some other method do not need to move to remain aloft.
  Species with glider membranes cannot gain altitude while flying. They
  descend one metre every time they move forwards and cannot use more
  than one minor action for flying movement in a round. Winged flight is
  tiring and can only be sustained for a number of rounds equal to the
  creature’s Endurance before requiring a like amount of rest. Some
  specialized avians can increase this to minutes or even hours equal to
  Endurance.

- **Fragile:** Members of this species are rather fragile and suffer 1.5
  times normal damage delivered by bludgeoning melee weapons.

- **Frightful Presence**: This Non-Human species trait makes a member of
  this species' very presence unsettling to foes. It takes effect
  automatically when the creature performs some sort of dramatic action
  (such as charging, attacking, or snarling). Opponents within range who
  witness the action may become shaken, suffering a –1 DM on all skill
  checks and ability checks until the end of the encounter. Fearful
  presence affects all opponents within Short range. An affected
  opponent can resist the effects with an opposed Persuade skill check.
  An opponent that succeeds in this check is immune to the Non-Human
  specie’s frightful presence for 24 hours. The Non-Human species gains
  a +2 DM on opposed Persuade skill checks for the purposes of this
  trait only.

- **Gearhead**: Members of this species are talented builders, and gain
  a +2 DM on any Trade skill check.

- **Gendermorphic**: Members of this species can enter into a state of
  hibernation lasting a number of days equal to 2d6 – Endurance
  modifier, minimum of one day, during which they can transform from one
  gender to another. Specifics related to any Referee–imposed
  limitations on this ability are provided in the species’ racial
  description.

- **Good First Impression**: Members of this species possess an almost
  universally pleasing appearance or physical trait that invokes an
  instinctive reaction in races other than their own. Most races will
  automatically have an Friendly attitude towards these characters,
  although this is overcome after an individual has interacted with the
  character for a few minutes, based on the character’s personality and
  the circumstances of their interaction.

- **Gravity Intolerance**: Members of this species evolved on a world
  with only a trace level of gravity and suffer greatly when exposed to
  higher gravity fields. Characters suffer a –1 DM on all attack, skill
  and save checks in Low gravity areas (0.4–0.7 G), a –2 DM in Average
  Gravity and Heavy Gravity (1.3–1.5 G) and a – 4 penalty under
  Oppressive Gravity (1.6G or higher).

- **Great Leaper**: Members of this species can jump great distances. As
  a significant action, a member of this species may make an Athletics
  skill check. If successful, it jumps four squares, plus a number of
  squares equal to the Effect of the skill check. In addition, members
  of this species are treated as having the Athletics skill at level 0.

- **Haggler**: Members of this species are exceptional traders, and gain
  a +2 DM on any Broker skill check.

- **Heat Endurance**: Members of this species do not suffer hourly
  damage from the effects of hot weather and exposure.

- **Heat Resistance**: Members of this species take half damage from
  heat–based effects, including fire.

- **Heat Vulnerability**: Members of this species are vulnerable to heat
  damage. Characters take half again as much (+50%) damage as normal
  from such effects.

- **Heavy Gravity Adaptation**: Members of this species evolved on a
  world with a higher gravity and do not have to acclimatize to
  high–gravity environments.

- **Hibernation**: Members of this species can voluntarily enter into a
  state of hibernation similar to that of cryosleep, but without the
  dangers, and remain in hibernation without need for food and water for
  a number of days equal to the character's Endurance score. An external
  stimulus (such as an alarm clock, a friend or taking physical damage)
  is required to awaken the character before the end of the hibernation
  period.

- **Hive Mentality**: Members of this species are driven by a hive
  mentality, and often pursue actions that support the greater good of
  their current identified family group, even at the risk of their own
  personal safety. Characters must make an Intelligence check to avoid
  risking their own safety when doing so would help their family group.
  The difficulty of the Intelligence check varies based on the degree of
  perceived benefit to the family group (this is usually an Average task
  (DM+0), although circumstances can arise where the difficulty ranges
  from Routine (DM+2) to Difficult (DM–2).)

- **Huge**: The species is extremely large compared to the average for
  sophonts. Huge creatures generally have a Strength and Endurance of
  3d6 or even 4d6, and a Dexterity of 1d6. Life support requirements for
  Huge creatures are doubled. Attacks against Huge creatures receive a
  +1 DM to hit.

- **Improved Grab**: Members of this species gain a +2 on Melee(unarmed)
  skill checks that involve grappling.

- **Improved Reach**: Members of this species have a natural reach that
  extends 1.5m longer than normal for their size and symmetry.

- **Interrogator**: Members of this species are highly intuitive about
  the psychology of others, and gain a +2 DM on any checks related to
  extracting information from others.

- **Intolerant**: Members of this species are intolerant of other races.
  Characters must make an Intelligence check to avoid challenging or
  attacking anyone that they perceive as insulting them. The difficulty
  of the Intelligence check varies based on the degree of perceived
  insult (this is usually an Average task (DM +0), although situations
  can arise where the difficulty ranges from Routine (DM +2) to
  Difficult (DM –2) or even worse for extreme forms of insult.)

- **Large**: The species is considerably larger than the average for
  sophonts. Large creatures generally have a Strength and Endurance of
  3d6 or even 4d6, and a Dexterity of 1d6. Life support requirements for
  Large creatures are doubled.

- **Light Blindness**: Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight
  or a daylight spell) blinds a member of this species for 1 round. In
  addition, members of this species take a –1 circumstance penalty on
  all skill checks and ability checks while operating in bright light.
  Sunglasses and tinted visors can negate light blindness.

- **Light Sensitivity**: Members of this species suffer a –1 penalty to
  all attacks made in bright sunlight or within the radius of effects
  that duplicate bright sunlight. Sunglasses and tinted visors can
  negate light sensitivity.

- **Low Gravity Adaptation**: Members of this species evolved on a world
  with a lower gravity and do not have to acclimatize to low–gravity
  environments.

- **Low–Light Vision**: Members of this species can see twice as far as
  a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of
  poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and
  detail under these conditions.

- **Multiple Limbs**: Members of this species have multiple limbs and
  can use more than two light or one– handed weapons or multiple
  two–handed weapons simultaneously. In addition, members of this
  species may engage in one additional action without incurring a
  penalty for multiple actions. (Regardless of the number of extra
  limbs, the character does not gain more than one additional action at
  no penalty.) The number of limbs for this species is defined under the
  species traits.

- **Natural Advocate**: Members of this species follow highly codified
  social interaction practices, and thus gain a +2 DM on any Advocate
  skill check.

- **Natural Born Leader**: Members of this species have an innate
  natural charisma or bearing that promotes respect and obedience, and
  gain a +2 DM on any Leadership skill check.

- **Natural Climber**: Members of this species are natural climbers and
  gain a +2 DM on all skill checks related to climbing.

- **Natural Compass**: Members of this species have an innate sense of
  planetary magnetic fields and can always identify the north pole of a
  planet. They gain a +2 DM on any navigation or orienteering–based
  check to avoid becoming lost on a planetary surface.

- **Natural Pilot**: Members of this species have an innate
  understanding of multi–dimensional space, and so receive a +2 DM to
  their Pilot and Astrogation checks.

- **Natural Survivalist**: Members of this species gain a +2 DM on
  Survival checks made in environments similar to their natural
  conditions. Such characters are naturally adept at staying alive in
  the harsh conditions of their homeworld.

- **Natural Swimmer**: Members of this species are natural swimmers and
  gain a +2 DM on all skill checks related to swimming.

- **Natural Thief**: Members of this species get a +2 DM on Deception
  skill checks.

- **Natural Weapon**: The species has a natural weapon, such as claws, a
  strong bite or a poisonous stinger. Such weapons are usable at
  Personal range and generally deal 1d6 damage. The creature gains Melee
  (natural weapons) at level 0.

- **Naturally Curious**: Members of this species are driven by a natural
  sense of curiosity, and are easily dragged into any adventure. They
  have to check out everything and always want to know what’s behind a
  potential mystery. Characters must make an Intelligence check to avoid
  acting on their curious impulses. The difficulty of the Intelligence
  check varies based on the degree of perceived mystery (this is usually
  an Average task (DM+0), although circumstances can arise where the
  difficulty ranges from Routine (DM+2) to Difficult (DM–2).)

- **Naturally Honest**: Members of this species are lousy liars,
  although they rarely even consider falsehood as an option or even a
  valid concept. Characters that wish to lie suffer a –4 DM on all
  interpersonal skill checks when doing so, as they are extremely
  uncomfortable with the idea of not telling the truth.

- **No Fine Manipulators**: The species has no fingers or other
  prehensile appendages, preventing them from easily picking things up,
  pushing small buttons, reaching into tight spaces, and so on.

- **No Land Movement**: Members of this species do not possess the
  ability to walk on land, and use some other form of movement to travel
  about their native environment. At best, such a creature might be able
  to travel 1.5 meters a round, pulling themselves along the ground
  through the use of other limbs.

- **No Vocal Cords**: Members of this species do not possess vocal
  cords, and communicate non–verbally through any of a variety of
  methods, such as sign language, telepathy, complex color changes in
  the skin, etc., as defined in the species description.

- **Notable (Characteristic)**: Some species are notably dexterous,
  intelligent, tough or strong. Characters from such races have a
  positive Dice Modifier when rolling for that characteristic (+2 unless
  otherwise specified), and their racial maximum for that characteristic
  is increased by the same amount.

- **Organic Radio** **Communication**: Members of this species can send
  and receive radio waves through a special sensory organ, allowing them
  to communicate with other members of this species as well as with
  specially tuned communicators. The individual range of this ability is
  5 km, but working together, a large number of this race can increase
  this range up to 50 km.

- **Overly Aggressive**: Members of this species are always ready to
  leap into violent action, and gain a +2 DM on Initiative checks.

- **Pleasant Odor**: Members of this species have a strong odor that
  most creatures find pleasing. Any creature with a sense of smell gains
  a +2 DM on skill checks to detect the character. Creatures that smell
  the character's pleasant odor find it difficult to harm the character,
  and must make an Routine (DM +0) Intelligence check to take hostile
  action against the character within olfactory range.

- **Poisonous**: The bite or sting attack of members of this species is
  poisonous. (Only species with a natural bite or sting attack can gain
  this ability.) The poison inflicts 1d6 damage to Endurance, unless the
  target makes a successful Endurance check. The character is immune to
  their species’ poison.

- **Poor Hearing**: Members of this species possess poor hearing, and
  suffer a –2 species penalty on all checks related to hearing.

- **Poor Vision**: Members of this species possess poor vision, and
  suffer a –2 species penalty on all checks related to vision.

- **Psionic**: All members of the species are Psionic, and may determine
  their Psionic Strength and talents at the start of character
  generation. A species cannot have this Non-Human species trait and the
  Anti–Psionic Non-Human species trait at the same time.

- **Racial Defense**: Members of this species are trained from birth to
  defend themselves in combat against members of another species, as
  determined by the history and culture of the species. When engaged in
  personal combat with members of that species, the offending species
  suffer a –2 DM on attacks against this species.

- **Racial Enemy**: Members of this species gain a +1 DM on attack rolls
  against members of another species, as determined by the history and
  culture of the species.

- **Racial Phobia**: Members of this species possess a racial fear or
  phobia, as designated by the Referee and described in the species'
  racial description. Characters must make an Intelligence check to
  temporarily overcome their racial fear, with the difficulty of the
  Intelligence check based on the degree of effort required to challenge
  the racial fear (usually Average (DM +0), although situations can
  arise where the difficulty ranges from Routine (DM +2) to Difficult
  (DM –2) or even worse for extreme confrontations.)

- **Racial Weapon**: Members of this species gain a +1 DM on attack
  rolls when using specific weapons of significant importance to the
  species' society, as determined by the history and culture of the
  species.

- **Radiation Resistance**: A member of this species reduces all
  radiation damage received by 100 rads.

- **Regeneration**: Species with this extraordinary ability can heal
  wounds and injuries rapidly. An injured character regains a number of
  characteristic points equal to his 1d6 + Endurance DM per hour of full
  rest, or 1 + Endurance DM per hour when the character is active.
  Characters with a low Endurance DM (quite possibly from injury) may
  degrade (lose more characteristic points) over time if they are
  unlucky or cannot (or will not) rest. A seriously wounded character
  only regains characteristic points equal to his Endurance DM per hour
  of rest, and so may need to receive immediate medical attention due to
  their heightened metabolism. Regeneration may also be applied to the
  growing of new limbs or organs to replace lost ones, although the
  recovery occurs daily rather than hourly in such cases. Regeneration
  may not be used to counteract aging.

- **Resistant to Diseases**: Members of this species are highly
  resistant to infection, gaining a +2 DM on Endurance checks to resist
  the effects of diseases.

- **Resistant to Fear**: Members of this species gain a +2 DM on any
  skill check or attribute check to resist fear–based effects.

- **Resistant to Poisons**: Members of this species are highly resistant
  to toxins, gaining a +2 DM on Endurance checks to resist the effects
  of diseases.

- **Resistant to Psionics**: Members of this species are innately
  resistant to psionics. They gain a +2 DM on any skill check or
  attribute check to resist psionic abilities, and suffer a –2 DM to
  their Psionic Strength rating. A species cannot have this Non-Human
  species trait and the Anti–Psionic Non-Human species trait at the same
  time.

- **Scent**: Members of this species have a powerful sense of smell, and
  gain a +2 DM on any skill check or attribute check involving the sense
  of smell. This DM also applies to any situation where scent can help
  in tracking others.

- **Slow Metabolism**: Creatures with a slow metabolism require less
  food than most species, and their life support costs are halved. In
  combat, slow– metabolism creatures suffer a –2 initiative penalty.

- **Slow Speed**: Species with this Non-Human species trait move at
  speeds slower than that of normal humans.

- **Small**: Small species generally have a Strength and Endurance of
  only 1d6, and a Dexterity of 3d6.

- **Spitting Attack**: Members of this species possess a ranged spitting
  attack, requiring a successful Athletics (throwing) skill check up to
  a range of Short, which deals 1d6 points of damage.

- **Stability**: Members of this species gain a +2 DM on skill checks
  and ability checks to resist forced physical movement when standing on
  the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not
  standing firmly on the ground).

- **Stalwart Movement**: Members of this species can move at their base
  speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a
  medium and heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced
  in such situations).

- **Stealthy**: Members of this species are particularly sneaky, and
  gain a +2 DM on any Stealth skill check.

- **Taint Immunity**: Members of this species are immune to most
  atmospheric taints.

- **Tainted Breather**: Members of this species cannot survive without
  the taint of their native atmosphere. If exposed to another atmosphere
  that lacks the appropriate taint without the proper life support,
  characters suffer the usual effects of suffocation, in addition to any
  other effects listed in the description of the planetary atmosphere.

- **Telepathy, Limited**: Members of this species can communicate
  telepathically with any other character within Short Range that has a
  language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once
  telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with
  more than one character at a time is just as difficult as
  simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people at the same
  time. A species cannot have this Non-Human species trait and the
  Anti–Psionic Non-Human species trait at the same time.

- **Telepathy**: Members of this species can communicate telepathically
  with any other character within Medium range that has a language. It
  is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically,
  although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one
  character at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking
  and listening to multiple people at the same time. A species cannot
  have this Non-Human species trait and the Anti–Psionic Non-Human
  species trait at the same time.

- **Tiny**: Tiny species generally have a Strength and Endurance of only
  1d6, and a Dexterity of 3d6. The minimum size for a sophont is about
  half that of a human. Attacks against Tiny creatures receive a –1 DM
  to hit.

- **Trace Breather, Limited**: Members of this species can breathe a
  Trace atmosphere (although with some discomfort) for up to an hour
  without harm.

- **Trace Breather**: A members of this species can breathe a Trace
  atmosphere without difficulty.

- **Trustworthy**: Members of this species are particularly trustworthy,
  and gain a +2 DM on any Diplomat skill check.

- **Unusual Hand Structure**: The articulation of this species’
  manipulators (hands, tentacles, etc.) are sufficiently different
  enough from human hands that members of this species suffer a –1 DM
  when attempting to use equipment designed for the human hand, and vice
  versa.

- **Unusual Life Support Requirements, Major**: Members of this species
  have unusual life support requirements (such as high humidity
  environment, etc.), as defined by the Referee, that rather quickly
  harm characters of this species when they are not met. Although the
  character may otherwise be meeting their normal requirements for
  living, the absence of these unusual life support requirements affects
  the character using the same rules as dehydration.

- **Unusual Life Support Requirements, Minor**: Members of this species
  have unusual life support requirements (such as high humidity
  environment, etc.), as defined by the Referee, that slowly harm
  characters of this species when they are not met. Although the
  character may otherwise be meeting their normal requirements for
  living, the absence of these unusual life support requirements affects
  the character using the same rules as starvation.

- **Unusual Sleep Cycle**: Members of this species have not adapted to
  the universal standard of a 24–hour day, and still operate physically
  on a sleep cycle based on their homeworld's rotation period.
  Characters require approximately one third of the time out of their
  homeworld's rotation period (i.e. 10–11 hours out of every 32 hours
  for a homeworld with a rotation period of 32 hours) or they will begin
  to suffer fatigue and exhaustion.

- **Uplifted**: This species was originally non–sentient, but has been
  raised to a higher intelligence by another species. Uplifted races
  generally become client species of their patron.

  - ***Uplifted apes*** have Notable Strength and Endurance (+2) but all
    other characteristics are Weak (–2). They have the Uplifted trait.

  - ***Uplifted dolphins*** have Notable Strength (+4) and Notable
    Endurance (+2) but Weak Intelligence, Education and Social Standing
    (–2). They have the Uplifted, Aquatic (fully aquatic, air-breathers)
    and No Fine Manipulators traits.

- **Vacuum Survival, Limited**: Members of this species can survive in
  zero–atmosphere environments for 15 minutes without harm.

- **Vacuum Survival**: A member of this species creates its own oxygen
  supply or doesn’t need to breathe at all. It can exist in
  zero–atmosphere environments.

- **Vibration Sense**: Members of this species with vibration sense
  automatically senses the location of anything that is in contact with
  the ground and within range. Aquatic characters with vibration sense
  can also sense the location of characters moving through water. If no
  straight path exists through the ground from the character to those
  that it’s sensing, then the range defines the maximum distance of the
  shortest indirect path. It must itself be in contact with the ground,
  and the sensed creatures must be moving. As long as the other
  creatures are taking physical actions, they’re considered moving; they
  don’t have to move from place to place for a character with vibration
  sense to detect them.

- **Water Dependent**: Although members of this species are amphibious,
  they can only survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points of
  Endurance (after that, refer to the drowning rules).

- **Weak (Characteristic)**: The opposite of Notable (Characteristic),
  some species are weaker, less resilient or less well educated than
  others. Characters from such races have a negative Dice Modifier when
  rolling for that characteristic (–2 unless otherwise specified), and
  their racial maximum for that characteristic is decreased by the same
  amount.

- **Well–Traveled**: Members of this species receive a +2 DM on Sense
  Motive and Gather Information checks.

- **Xeno–Empathy**: Members of this species possess a natural empathy
  for other species, and gain a +2 DM on any Carouse skill check.

- **Zero–Gravity Adaptation**: Members of this species evolved on a
  world with little or no discernible gravity and gain a +2 DM on any
  Zero–G skill check. In addition, they are treated as having the Zero–G
  skill at level 0.

## Building Custom Non-Human Species

### GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS 

> The Traveller rules assumes that the basic character is effectively
> human: a warm–blooded bipedal humanoid creature derived from
> omnivore/hunter stock with two arms, hands as manipulators, the usual
> array of senses, and so forth. Non-Human species described by the
> following species generation method assume that, unless otherwise
> indicated, game mechanics for a non-Human species follow the same
> rules as humans do. For example, unless described otherwise, a
> non-Human species has two arms with hands that can type on a human
> keyboard, hold a laser pistol and punch somebody the same way as a
> human does, and so uses the same rules. As part of the species
> generation method, the Referee creates a description of the non-Human
> species that contains the game mechanics to address any significant
> differences in how the race interacts with the rules of the game.
>
> By the nature of a diverse universe, it would take a good number of
> books to describe all the possible variations in detail of a
> lifeform's appearance. This method, in the desire to remain somewhat
> concise, uses descriptions that are quite general, leaving room for
> the Referee to better detail the physical appearance of the non-Human
> species, such as the color of the race's skin, the number of fingers
> (if it even has fingers), and so on. These cosmetic elements do not
> have a significant impact on the game mechanics detailing an Non-Human
> species, and so are left under the control of the Referee.
>
> When completed, the non-Human species racial description generated as
> a result of this species generation method can be used to introduce a
> new race to a Referee's Traveller campaign. However, the Referee is
> encouraged to review the final results to ensure that they make sense,
> and adjust them as desired. Indeed, at any point in time along the
> generation process, the Referee is encouraged to make decisions or
> adjustments rather than let the dice dictate the results. This ensures
> that the final result reflects the Referee's concepts for their
> Traveller gaming experience.

### DETERMINE EXISTENCE OF SENTIENT LIFE 

> Before the Referee can generate a non-human species, they must first
> select the homeworld of a prospective new race. This can be done
> arbitrarily or can be identified from a pre–existing set of UWPs using
> the Referee's choice of world generation methods. For the purposes of
> this non-human species generation method, the following process is
> suggested, as it tends to result in approximately four–six races per
> sector, which seems a good balance.

#### Is This a Homeworld? 

> If, in the mind of the Referee, native life exists on a world and is
> complex enough to have evolved potential sentient life, determine if a
> non-Human species has evolved on this world. This usually occurs on
> Agricultural and Garden worlds. On such worlds, this system suggests
> rolling 3d6. On a roll of 17+, the planet is home to a sentient race.

### DETERMINE HOMEWORLD QUALITIES 

> Certain world conditions automatically establish specific non-human
> species traits for the races that evolved on them.
>
> These specific qualities are detailed below:

#### World Size 

> A world’s gravity can negatively affect human characters. In order to
> reflect the impact such conditions have on a species that naturally
> evolved on a world with a different surface gravity, a species may
> gain certain non-human species traits based on the world’s size
> rating.
>
> **World Size 0** (No Gravity): The non-human species automatically
> gains the Zero–Gravity Adaptation and Gravity Intolerance non-human
> species traits.
>
> **World Size 1–3** (Trace Gravity): The non-human species
> automatically gains the Low Gravity Adaptation and Gravity Intolerance
> non-human species traits.
>
> **World Size 4–6** (Low Gravity): The non-human species automatically
> gains the Low Gravity Adaptation non-human species trait.
>
> **World Size 7–9** (Average Gravity): Worlds of this size do not grant
> any non-human species traits to an non-human species.
>
> **World Size A+** (High Gravity): The non-human species automatically
> gains the Heavy Gravity Adaptation non-human species trait.

#### World Atmosphere 

> A planet’s atmosphere can seriously affect human characters. In order
> to reflect the impact these conditions have on a species that
> naturally evolved on such a world, a species may gain certain
> non-human species traits based on the world’s atmosphere rating.

- **World Atmosphere 0** (No Atmosphere): The non-human species
  automatically gains the Vacuum Survival non-human species trait.

- **World Atmosphere 1** (Trace Atmosphere): The non-human species
  automatically gains the Trace Breather non-human species trait. Roll
  2d6; on a roll of 11+, the non-human species also gains the Vacuum
  Survival, Limited non-human species trait.

- **World Atmosphere 2, 3** (Very Thin Atmosphere): The non-human
  species automatically gains the Trace Breather, Limited non-human
  species trait. Roll 2d6; on a roll of 11+, the non-human species gains
  the Trace Breather and Vacuum Survival, Limited non-human species
  traits instead.

- **World Atmosphere 4, 5** (Thin Atmosphere): Worlds of this atmosphere
  classification do not grant any non-human species traits to an
  non-human species.

- **World Atmosphere 6, 7** (Standard Atmosphere): Worlds of this
  atmosphere classification do not grant any non-human species traits to
  an non-human species.

- **World Atmosphere 8, 9** (Dense Atmosphere): Worlds of this
  atmosphere classification do not grant any non-human species traits to
  an non-human species.

- **World Atmosphere A** (Exotic Atmosphere): The non-human species
  automatically gains the Atmospheric Requirements non-human species
  trait.

- **World Atmosphere B** (Corrosive Atmosphere):

- The non-human species automatically gains the Atmospheric Requirements
  non-human species trait.

- **World Atmosphere C** (Insidious Atmosphere): The non-human species
  automatically gains the Atmospheric Requirements non-human species
  trait.

- **World Atmosphere 2, 4, 7, 9 (Tainted Atmosphere):** The non-human
  species automatically gains the Tainted Breather non-human species
  trait. Roll 2d6; on a roll of 9+, the non-human species loses the
  Tainted Breather non-human species trait and gains the Taint Immunity
  non-human species trait instead.

#### World Hydrographics 

> A world’s average hydrographics (or percent of surface water) can
> impact human characters, particularly in terms of desert worlds and
> water worlds. In order to reflect the impact these conditions have on
> a species that naturally evolved on such planets, a species may gain
> certain non-human species traits based on the world’s hydrographics
> rating.

- **World Hydrographics 0** (Desert World): The non-human species
  automatically gains the Desert Adaptation non-human species trait.

- **World Hydrographics 1–5** (Dry World): Worlds of this hydrographics
  classification do not grant any non-human species traits to an
  non-human species.

- **World Hydrographics 6–9** (Wet World): Worlds of this hydrographics
  classification do not grant any non-human species traits to an
  non-human species.

- **World Hydrographics A** (Water or Fluid World): The non-human
  species automatically gains the Aquatic and Natural Swimmer non-human
  species traits. Roll 2d6; on a roll of 10+, the non-human species also
  gains the Amphibious non-human species trait and must roll 2d6 again.
  On a roll of 6+, the amphibious non-human species also gains the Water
  Dependent non-human species trait.

#### World Climate 

> The average surface temperature of a world negatively impacts human
> characters. In order to reflect the impact these have on a species
> that naturally evolved on a planet outside of Earth’s ranges, a
> species may gain certain non-human species traits based on the world’s
> climate rating.

- **World Climate Chilly–** (Average surface temperature below 0 degrees
  Celsius): The non-human species automatically gains the Cold Endurance
  non-human species trait.

- **World Climate Cold–** (Average surface temperature –25 degrees
  Celsius or lower): The non-human species automatically gains the Cold
  Endurance, Cold Resistance and Fire Vulnerability non-human species
  traits

- **World Climate Warm** (Average surface temperature between 0 degrees
  Celsius and 25 degrees Celsius): Worlds of this climate do not grant
  any non-human species traits to an non-human species.

- **World Climate Tropical+** (Average surface temperature above 25
  degrees Celsius): The non-human species automatically gains the Heat
  Endurance non-human species trait.

- **World Climate Hot+** (Average surface temperature above 45 degrees
  Celsius): The non-human species automatically gains the Heat
  Endurance, Fire Resistance and Cold Vulnerability non-human species
  traits.

### DETERMINE ECOLOGICAL STOCK 

> Lifeforms in Traveller are defined by the ecological niche they fill.
> Humans, for example, evolved from omnivore/hunter stock. As the
> Traveller core rules assume that humans are the basis for the game
> mechanics involving characters, the Ecological Type
>
> For Intelligent Lifeforms and Ecological Subtype By Type tables are
> weighted toward generating omnivore/hunters. Roll 2d6 to determine the
> species’ primary type on the Ecological Type For Intelligent Lifeforms
> table, then roll 2d6 on Ecological Subtype By Type table under the
> appropriate subtype to determine the species’ subtype.

The ecological stock from which a species evolved impacts a number of
other factors and non-human species traits, and so must be determined
early on.

### DETERMINE DESCRIPTION 

> This section is mostly descriptive, although the results here can
> impact game mechanics for aspects of the non-human species that are
> non–human.

#### Metabolism 

> In general, most non-human species have some capacity to regulate and
> maintain a body temperature range that is optimal for biological
> efficiency. These species are warm–blooded. Roll 2d6; on a roll of
> 11+, an non-human species is considered cold–blooded, and gains the
> Cold–Blooded non-human species trait.

#### Sexs

Like most creatures on earth, creatures generally have different
biological expressions of sexual characteristics controlled by various
chromosomes. This is what is common among mammals and insects. There are
other systems that produce two different biological expressions;
however, they do not use the XX/XY chromosomes. For example, ants and
bees sexual determination system not determined at fertilization, but
after the organism has developed to haploid. Some reptiles and turtles
have systems that determine their biological expression based on the
temperature the eggs are at as they await hatching. The clown fish will
change sexual expression; the dominate fish becomes the female, and the
others become male. Finally, some amphibians, lizards, and rabbits can
switch between asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction based on
environmental factors.

There is speculation in science fiction that has explored non-human
species with different forms of sexual determination systems and
reproductive approaches. For example, in Shadow Man by Melissa Scott,
the story has five different biological expressions. Male, Female, Mem,
Fem, and Herm. To determine the number of sexs for an non-human species,
roll 2d6 and consult the table below. If you are creating a plant, roll
1d6+1.

If the creature you are creating is a plant and you want to find out how
it reproduces,

##### Autogamy / Self Fertilization

##### Apomixis

Apomixis is the process of asexual reproduction through seed, in the
absence of meiosis and fertilization, generating clonal progeny of
maternal origin.

##### Runners

Also known as stolons, runners are modified stems that, unlike rhizomes,
grow from existing stems just below the soil surface. As they are
propagated, the buds on the modified stems produce roots and stems.
Examples of plants that use runners are strawberries and currants.

##### Bulbs

Bulbs are inflated parts of the stem within which lie the central shoots
of new plants. They are typically underground and are surrounded by
plump and layered leaves that provide nutrients to the new plant.
Examples of plants that use bulbs are shallots, lilies and tulips.

##### Tubers & Corms

Tubers develop from either the stem or the root. Stem tubers grow from
rhizomes or runners that swell from storing nutrients while root tubers
propagate from roots that are modified to store nutrients and get too
large and produce a new plant. Examples of stem tubers are potatoes and
yams and examples of root tubers are sweet potatoes and dahlias. Corms
are solid enlarged underground stems that store nutrients in their
fleshy and solid stem tissue and are surrounded by papery leaves. Corms
differ from bulbs in that their centers consists of solid tissue while
bulbs consist of layered leaves. Examples of plants that use corms are
gladiolus and taro.

##### Suckers

Also known as root sprouts, suckers are plant stems that arise from buds
on the base of the parent plant's stems or roots. Examples of plants
that use suckers are apple, elm, and banana trees.

##### Plantlets

Plantlets are miniature structures that arise from meristem in leaf
margins that eventually develops roots and drop from the leaves they
grew on. An example of a plant that uses plantlets is the Alligator
plant which is also known as mother of thousands for its many plantlets.

##### Keikis

Keikis are additional offshoots which develop on vegetative stems or
flower stalks found among orchids.

##### Allogamy / Cross-Fertilization

#### Respiration 

> Most non-human species in Traveller follow the human model, and
> breathe air. Roll 2d6, DM+2 if the homeworld's hydrographics rating is
> 8 or higher; a roll of 12+ indicates that the non-human species
> evolved from aquatic stock, assuming that the homeworld is not a
> desert world. An aquatic non-human species automatically gains the

### DETERMINE SIZE

The size of an non-human species determines a number of significant
details in regards to game mechanics, and influences quite a range of
other options as well. To determine the size of a species, roll 2d6,
modified using the DMs provided, and consult the non-human species Size
table below.

> **2d6 Size**
>
> **2. 2 Tiny**
>
> **3. 3 Small**
>
> **4. 4 Small**
>
> **5. 5 Medium**
>
> **6. 6 Medium**
>
> **7. 7 Medium**
>
> **8. 8 Medium**
>
> **9. 9 Medium**
>
> **10. 10 Medium**
>
> **11. 11 Large**
>
> **12. 12 Large**
>
> **13. 13 Large**
>
> **14. 14 Huge**
>
> **DMs**: World Size 8+, DM–1 World Size 4–, DM+1
>
> Flyer, DM–2
>
> Natural Swimmer, DM+2

The benefits and penalties for a species’ size should be included in the
racial traits of the species description generated at the end of this
process. These benefits and penalties are summarized for ease of
reference below.

- **Tiny**: Tiny species generally have a Strength and Endurance of only
  1d6, and a Dexterity of 3d6. The minimum size for a sophont is about
  half that of a human. Attacks against Tiny creatures receive a –1 DM
  to hit.

- **Small**: Small species generally have a Strength and Endurance of
  only 1d6, and a Dexterity of 3d6.

- **Medium**: Species of a medium size receive no special bonuses or
  penalties due to their size.

- **Large**: The species is considerably larger than the average for
  sophonts. Large creatures generally have a Strength and Endurance of
  3d6 or even 4d6, and a Dexterity of 1d6. Life support requirements for
  Large creatures are doubled.

- **Huge**: The species is extremely large compared to the average for
  sophonts. Huge creatures generally have a Strength and Endurance of
  3d6 or even 4d6, and a Dexterity of 1d6. Life support requirements for
  Huge creatures are doubled. Attacks against Huge creatures receive a
  +1 DM to hit.

### DETERMINE MOVEMENT 

> This section determines elements that impact a species movement.

#### Locomotion 

> Most non-human species move much like humans do, using limbs to
> ambulate from one location to another. Some sentient races retain a
> racial ability to swim underwater or fly through the air. Some species
> even possess a natural ability to climb sheer surfaces. To determine
> any additional locomotive methods of a species, roll 2d6 and consult
> the non-human species Locomotive Methods table below.

**(\*) Note**: If a species has the Amphibious non-human species trait,
roll 2d6 again; on a result of 6+, the amphibious non-human species also
gains the Water Dependent non-human species trait.

**Homeworld Limitations**: If a homeworld does not have at least a thin
atmosphere (Atmosphere code 4+), then the species cannot have the Flyer
non-human species trait. If the world does not have free standing fluid
oceans (such as a desert world, an asteroid belt or an ice–capped
world), the species cannot have the Natural Swimmer, Deep Diver,
Amphibious or Water Dependent non-human species traits.

#### Body Symmetry & Number of Limbs 

> As most non-human species in fiction tend to follow the humanoid body
> frame, it is assumed that most non-human species in Traveller will
> follow a similar trend. Roll 2d6 and consult the Body Symmetry And
> Limb Count table below to determine body symmetry. Using the same line
> on the table, determine the number of limbs.

###### 2d6 Symmetry Limb Count 

2.  Trilateral (1d3+1)x3

3.  Bilateral 4 (2 pairs)

4.  Bilateral 4 (2 pairs)

5.  Bilateral 4 (2 pairs)

6.  Bilateral 4 (2 pairs)

7.  Bilateral 4 (2 pairs)

8.  Bilateral 4 (2 pairs)

9.  Bilateral 6 (3 pairs) 10 Bilateral 8 (4 pairs)

<!-- -->

11. Bilateral 2d6 pairs

12. Radial 2d3+1

- **Radial Symmetry**: For all creatures with radial symmetry, all limbs
  are assumed to be used as both arms and legs. Flying creatures with
  radial symmetry are assumed to fly primarily through lighter–than–air
  means.

- **Bilateral Symmetry**: Bilateral creatures have at least one pair of
  hands/manipulators. Flying bilateral species have at least one pair of
  wings. Use the Limb Group Types table below to randomly assign limb
  types to any remaining pairs. If a creature has more than eight limbs,
  assume that the remainder of the results are legs and only roll for
  the first four pairs.

- **Trilateral Symmetry**: Trilateral creatures have at least one group
  of three limbs act as hands/manipulators. Flying creatures with
  trilateral symmetry are more likely to fly through lighter–than– air
  means, and so do not necessarily require wings to fly. If no limb
  groups generate wings for a flying creature, then assume the species
  flies through lighter– than–air means. Use the Limb Group Types table
  below to randomly assign limb types to each group of three appendages.

- **No Land Movement Note**: Species with the No Land Movement non-human
  species trait (from Locomotion above) do not gain legs. Any locomotive
  limbs generated on the Limb Group Types table automatically convert to
  the appropriate type (wings or fins).

- **Multiple Limbs Note**: If a race has multiple limbs designated for
  manipulation, the non-human species gains the Multiple Limbs non-human
  species trait.

- **No Legs Results**: If a race has no legs after creating their limb
  group types, the non-human species gains the No Land Movement
  non-human species trait if it does not already possess it.
  Alternately, the Referee may assign a limb group to be legs, to insure
  the species has a base land speed.

#### Speed 

> A species’ movement speed is based on a number of factors: size,
> locomotion type, number of locomotive limbs, body symmetry, ecological
> type and subtype, for example. For each locomotion type available to
> the non-human species, roll 2d6, apply the appropriate DMs and consult
> the Comparative Movement Rate table below to determine if the species
> is Slow, Average or Fast. (Note that flying creatures that use
> lighter–than–air methods are automatically Slow.) Finally, consult the
> Movement By Size And Type table to get the actual base movement speed
> of the non-human species for each movement type.

- **Burst of Speed**: Roll 2d6, DM–1 if the species has a Slow
  comparative movement. On a roll of 12+, the species gains the Burst of
  Speed non-human species trait. **Stability**: Roll 2d6, DM +2 if
  species is multi– legged (i.e. non–bipedal), DM–1 if the species has a
  Fast comparative movement. On a roll of 12+, the species gains the
  Stability non-human species trait.

- **Stalwart Movement**: Roll 2d6, DM–1 if the species has a Fast
  comparative movement. On a roll of 12+, the species gains the Stalwart
  Movement non-human species trait.

- **Recording Movement**: If a species has a land movement rate of less
  than 6m, then they should receive the Slow Speed non-human species
  trait, and the Referee should note their speed. If a species has a
  land movement rate of more than 6m, then the species should receive
  the Fast Speed non-human species trait, along with a notation of their
  speed.

### DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES 

Ability scores define a character's capacities relative to other
characters. Humans, as the base from which all other characters are
compared, do not have any modifications to their ability scores.
However, other species may have natural tendencies that are above or
below those of humans. These are reflected within the game system as
racial ability score modifiers. This non-human species generation method
determines ability score modifiers (if any) in the following order:
Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Education, Social Standing and finally
Intelligence. The results from previous steps often serve as modifiers
in the determination of ability scores later on in the process. When
used in this manner, an ability score bonus serves as a penalty, while
an ability score penalty serves as a bonus (i.e. the Referee should
subtract the modifier from the dieroll instead of adding it, thus
turning bonuses to penalties and vice versa.)

At each step in the process, the Referee will roll 2d6, modified as
listed in each section, and compare the results to the Ability Score
Modifier table. The end results may be further constrained to certain
values, as listed in each section below.

- **Feral**: Some races remain uncivilized, sometimes in spite of their
  surroundings or technological advancement. To determine if the species
  is feral, roll 2d6, DM+2 if the world’s Starport is either X or E,
  DM–2 if the world’s Starport is either A or B; on a result of 12+, the
  species gains the Feral trait and thus start with a Base Education of
  1d6 instead of the usual 2d6. Once the Base Education value is
  determined, determine the Education Ability Score Modifier as normal.

- **Caste, Charisma**: Non-human species may have different criteria for
  Social Standing: Caste or Charisma. Roll 2d6, DM –1 for Herbivore
  stock and DM +1 for Carnivore stock. A result of 2– indicates the
  species has the Caste non-human species trait, while a result of 12+
  indicates that the species has the Charisma non-human species trait.
  When dealing with a race that has a different concept of Social
  Standing, all DMs from Social Standing or its non-human species
  equivalent – whether positive or negative – are halved.

### DETERMINE NATURAL ARMOR 

> While most non-human species take damage in much the same way as
> humans, some retain strong natural defenses based on their physiology,
> while others are more susceptible to damage.

- **Fragile**: Roll 2d6, DM+4 if Flyer. On a roll of 12+, the species
  gains the Fragile non-human species trait.

- **Natural Armor**: If an non-human species does not have the Fragile
  non-human species trait, then the species may possess some form of
  natural protection. Roll 2d6, DM–1 if the race derives from carnivore
  stock, DM+1 if the race derives from scavenger stock, DM+2 if race
  derives from herbivore stock, DM–2 if race is Tiny, DM–1 if race is
  Small, DM+4 if race is Large, and DM+8 if race is Huge. If the result
  is 11+, then the species gains the Armoured non-human species trait.

### DETERMINE NATURAL WEAPONRY 

Most non-human species have evolved to intelligence due to a lack of
natural weaponry. However, some retain natural weapons due to their
physiology.

- **Natural Weapons**: If an non-human species does not have the Fragile
  non-human species trait (see the Determine Natural Armor section
  above), then the species may possess some form of natural offensive
  capacity. Roll 2d6, DM+3 if the race derives from carnivore stock,
  DM–1 if the race derives from scavenger stock, DM–2 if race derives
  from herbivore stock. If the result is 9+, then the species has the
  Natural Weapon non-human species trait. To determine what type of
  natural weapon, roll 2d6 on the Natural Weapons table below.

- **Poisonous**: If a species has a natural stinger attack, the species
  automatically gains the Poisonous non-human species trait for their
  stinger attack. If the species has a natural teeth attack, roll 2d6;
  on a roll of 10+, the species gains the Poisonous non-human species
  trait for their teeth attack.

- **Special Attacks**: An non-human species may have other special
  attack forms, but those are determined further on in this species
  generation method as Non-human species traits.

### DETERMINE SENSES 

> The core rules generally assume that a character's senses are roughly
> equivalent to those of a human. However, science fiction is filled
> with examples of non-human species whose senses extend into ranges
> beyond those perceived by humans, as well as those that lack senses
> commonly available to mankind.

- **Standard Senses**: If a species does not receive any non-human
  species traits related to senses, then it is considered to have
  Standard Senses. In regards to perception, the character is treated as
  having human–equivalent senses and sensory ranges.

#### Vision 

> Humans are very dependent on their ability to see the world around
> them. Sight is the sense most frequently used to perceive events that
> occur at range. It allows characters to target effectively at range,
> as well. Roll 2d6; on a result of 8+, roll 2d6 again and consult the
> Vision Table below.

#### Hearing 

The second most useful sense for humans is their sense of hearing.
Hearing allows a character to perceive events that occur at range. It
allows characters to target somewhat effectively at range, as well. Roll
2d6; on a result of 9+, roll 2d6 again and consult the Hearing Table
below.

- **No Vocal Cords**: Some races, even if they can hear perfectly well,
  do not communicate by verbal means. Roll 2d6; on a roll of 12+, the
  species gains the No Vocal Cords non-human species trait.

### Determine Non-Human Species Traits 

> An non-human species may have gained a number of non-human species
> traits previously, due to such their homeworld, size, metabolism,
> symmetry, locomotion, respiration, natural weapons, natural armor, and
> senses. However, an non-human species may have other non-human species
> traits in addition to those gained above. Roll 1d6–2, DM–1 for every
> two non-human species traits already gained above, to a minimum of
> zero. The result is the number of additional non-human species traits
> that can be selected for this race. Referees are free to select
> appropriate non-human species traits, or roll on the table below.

- **Randomly Determining Non-human species traits**: To use the tables
  below, the Referee first rolls 1d6 to determine which table to roll
  on: 1–4, Physical Qualities; 5–6 Cultural Qualities. Then the Referee
  must roll two d6, each a different color. The first d6 counts as the
  tens digit and the second d6 counts as the ones digit.

### DETERMINE FINISHING TOUCHES 

For ease of integrating non-human species with other characters,
Referees should determine some certain details, such as aging, height
and weight.

#### non-human species Life Cycles

> must roll 2d6 three times against each column of the non-human species
> Age table below.
>
> The first 2d6 roll on the table determines the starting age at which a
> species have reached maturity and can begin to pursue a career path.
>
> The second 2d6 roll determines the number of years to add to the

> rolls. The value in parentheses indicates the number of terms a
> typical character will have pursued by this point (assuming that the
> character does not pursue any career or educational opportunity that
> takes place over a period that is not four years in length).
>
> The third 2d6 roll provides an Aging Modifier for aging rolls. Species

#### Height Values 

> Height values are determined in two parts, a Base Height value and a
> Height Modifier. A species’ base height values are determined by
> rolling 2d6, modified by the DMs below, and consulting the appropriate
> column of the Base Height By Size table for the species’ size. This
> value is given in centimeters. The Height Modifier for individuals is
> determined solely by the species’ size, as given in the Height
> Modifier By Size table below.

- **Differences By Gender**: In the event that the Referee determines
  that a race's genders should be of different height, the Referee may
  pursue two courses of action. On the one hand, they may generate
  separate heights for each gender. Alternately, they may determine the
  height of the dominant gender, and then subtract the minimum value of
  the Height Modifier from the base height value for the dominant gender
  to obtain the new base height value for the lesser genders.

#### Weight Values 

> Weight values are determined in two parts, a Base Weight value and a
> Weight Modifier. A species’ base weight values are determined by
> rolling 2d6, modified by the DMs below, and consulting the appropriate
> column of the Base Weight By Size table for the species’ size. This
> value is given in kilograms. The Weight Modifier for individuals is
> determined by a second 2d6 roll against the Weight Modifier By Size
> table below.
>
> Differences By Gender: In the event that the Referee determines that a
> race's genders should be of different weight, the Referee may pursue
> two courses of action. On the one hand, they may generate separate
> weights for each gender. Alternately, they may determine the weight of
> the dominant gender, and then subtract five kilograms (fifty kilograms
> for Large and Huge species, and one kilogram for Small and Tiny
> species) from the base weight value for the dominant gender to obtain
> the new base weight value for the lesser genders.

### APPLY COMMON SENSE 

> When the Non-human species Generation process has been completed, the
> Referee will have a great collection of notes on a new non-human
> species in his Traveller campaign setting. However, like all random
> processes, sometimes the Referee will need to step in and make some
> changes. The Referee is strongly urged to keep both playability and
> fun in mind when reviewing his notes, and make any changes needed to
> finalize the non-human species before releasing this information to
> his players.

### RECORD NON-HUMAN SPECIES DETAILS 

After the Referee has completed the Non-human species Generation
process, he will need to take the time to record the details of the
non-human species, if only to help his players understand something of
the new non-human species that he has created. This is when the Referee
is most encouraged to be as creative as he desires.

### FURTHER DEVELOPMENT 

> Once an non-human species has been generated through this method, the
> Referee certainly has enough to run such characters in an adventure.
> However, the work does not have to stop here. In fact, further
> development of an non-human species can lead to a very rich and
> rewarding gaming experience. Some Referees may find the concept of
> developing an non-human species culture to be daunting. However, this
> section is intended to propose a method that provides the Referee (or
> interested and involved Players) with the tools to easily develop a
> rich and vibrant culture for this new non-human species.
>
> This method was inspired by a series of articles entitled "Distilled
> Cultural Essence," which were written by Mike Bourke. Although this
> guide provides a distillation of that wonderful advice, Referees
> curious for more information and details may wish to review this work
> at the following URL:
> <http://www.campaignmastery.com/blog/cultural-essence-1/>

#### STEP ONE 

> To begin this approach to cultural development, the Referee needs to
> identify the primary difference between the non-human species' culture
> and the common or baseline culture of the campaign setting. This may
> be inspired by one or more of the non-human species traits determined
> for this race, an existing modern or historical Terran culture, or
> ever some element of the setting's history or geography that imposes
> an external influence on this species. Common science fiction tropes
> include a race that embraces psionics, a warrior culture inspired by
> the mongol hordes of Asia, or a race of stoic xeno–phobic scholars
> devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. The Referee is encouraged to be
> creative, but should also be focused on playability.
>
> Once determined, this should be recorded at the beginning of a
> document as either a single sentence or short paragraph that easily
> captures this detail for the Referee.

#### STEP TWO 

> Once the primary difference has been determined for a specific
> species, the Referee should then write a small paragraph about why
> this species has become the way that they are. Perhaps this is based
> on the teachings of a single person or group earlier in the race's
> history. Maybe a more advanced non-human species imposed certain
> limitations on the non-human species race being developed, which led
> to the difference described in Step One. This could also be due to
> physical or psychological traits determined during the creation of the
> non-human species. This does not have to be a long paragraph, but
> should provide enough detail to help focus future development. This
> may also help the Referee come up with some adventure ideas, but that
> is beyond the scope of this particular method.

#### STEP THREE 

> Once Step Two has been recorded, the Referee should then examine some
> initial consequences of Steps One and Two on the culture of this
> non-human species. Consider the impact of these steps on a variety of
> areas in the non-human specie’s society: art, childhood, rites of
> passage, career choice, marriage, child raising, death, daily
> routines, personal hygiene, personal decoration, celebrations, local
> communities, legal issues, medical practices, mercantile experiences,
> military practices, personal ethics, and so on. The Referee is
> encouraged to note only major consequences (perhaps only one per
> element of society), so as to better capture an overall picture of the
> culture without becoming bogged down in the minutia.
>
> Once this step is complete, the Referee should have some solid ideas
> that are forming in regards to this non-human species culture. With
> this more solidified mental picture, the Referee should move on to the
> next step in the process.

#### STEP FOUR 

> This step is perhaps the most arduous, but also the most rewarding.
> Here, the Referee must consider the ramifications of the data gathered
> together in the first three steps of this process. Stepping back
> through the elements written down in Step Three, the Referee should
> add a sentence or two, perhaps more, of ramifications to each social
> element based on the other consequences outlined in Step Three. Not
> every consequence will have ramifications, but many of them will as
> the mental picture of the culture continues to solidify.
>
> Be aware that occasionally, another primary difference may evolve as
> the culture becomes more and more developed. That's perfectly fine.
> The Referee should make a note, and continue with this process. It is
> imperative not to start over, but rather simply make the notation and
> continue.

#### STEP FIVE 

> Once the first four steps in this process have been completed, then it
> is time to rewrite all of the information gathered into paragraphs.
> Because Steps Three and Four are organized around social elements,
> this process lends itself well to organizing the write–up along those
> themes. This write–up can be used to convey the information about this
> species to players, and adds depth and consistency to the campaign
> setting.

#### STEP SIX 

> The Referee is encouraged to write one final paragraph for the species
> write–up that captures the species' general reactions to outsiders,
> such as the player– characters. By waiting until the end of the
> process, the details of the culture are firmly set in mind and help to
> give this section more consistency with the overall culture.

#### ADDITIONAL OPTIONS 

> Once the six steps of the process have been complete, the Referee can
> easily stop the exercise, with a complete write–up of the non-human
> species culture. However, there are other options that the Referee
> could pursue in order to even further develop this new society for
> their campaign setting.
>
> For example, the Referee could skim through the cultural write–up,
> selecting the most important elements to write a single paragraph that
> serves as an introduction and a summary of the non-human species
> culture created through this process. This simple note should help
> serve as a reminder to the Referee, providing the tools necessary to
> help address details that come up during the gaming session that have
> not yet been addressed by the initial write–up.
>
> The Referee can create a series of expressions that help capture the
> philosophy of the non-human species culture.
>
> Whether these are written in a constructed language or a modern Terran
> tongue, these little gems can add additional flavor to the culture.
> Some Referees find it very rewarding to hear their players quote the
> Great Philosopher of a culture they've created and portrayed years
> later as they recount their tales of adventure during the lull of a
> future gaming session.
>
> Speaking of constructed languages, there's a lot of information on the
> Internet regarding the creation of constructed languages, both for
> gaming and for writing. Building a small lexicon, or even a simply
> name generation system, for an non-human species tongue can add a
> consistent flavor and depth to a setting.
>
> In terms of game mechanics, the Referee may also consider creating new
> career paths specifically for the non-human species culture they’ve
> created. New weapons, starships and other equipment add additional
> flavor to the setting, and help flesh out the presence of this culture
> in the campaign setting.

## Species Mutations

### Physical Beneficial Mutations 

#### Aberrant Form 

This mutation covers a wide array of effects over the entire bodily
structure of the mutant. Roll 1d8 to determine the nature of the
mutation.

1-2 *Enlarged Parts:* Some aspect of the mutant’s body has grown to an
abnormally large size and, as a result, has increased functionality.
Because this is a benefit all limbs and organs are assumed to be
affected in concert (i.e. both arms, both legs, etc.). For example, this
mutation could manifest as a +1, +2, or +3 to damage if arms are larger
than normal, or +60 to movement for longer or larger legs.

3-4 *Xenomorphism:* The character gains a unique organ/limb with a new
function, such as an extra pair of eyes on stalks, a prehensile
proboscis, a limb or body part from another species, or a set of
tentacles that act as extra arms. An extra body part from another
species may (50%) be equipped with a *natural weapon*.

5-6 *Extra Parts:* Any organ or limb that is normally present may be
multiplied. An extra normal organ (extra heart, extra set of lungs) may
be acquired, which could increase CON by +1. To generate a random number
of a given body part roll 1d4+1 and multiply by that number, or a number
may be selected. The brain and/or head cannot be duplicated by this
mutation. The body part must be selected at character generation.

*7-8 Natural Weapon:* The mutant is equipped with a natural weapon, such
as horns, teeth, or claws (select at character creation). These will
inflict damage as determined by rolling 1d8; 1-2 1d4, 3-4 1d6, 5-6 1d8,
7-8 1d10. The character may only attack once per round with a *natural
weapon*, unless he possesses more than one attack per round. A *natural
weapon* may (25%) be equipped with a *toxic weapon*, such as poison.

#### Chameleon Epidermis 

The mutant’s outer cellular structure has been mutated, allowing the
cells to actually alter their lucidness, appearance, and color. In
effect, this allows the mutant to subtly change colors on a cellular
level. The being may hide, if stationary, almost as if invisible. The
color change takes place immediately, and requires no concentration by
the mutant. The Mutant Lord should assign a percentage chance, based on
the situation, that the mutant will not be noticed when using this
camouflage. In complete darkness or thick cover, the percentage could be
95%, while in daylight if the character is unmoving it might be 50%.

Characters wearing heavy armor or fully garbed receive no benefit from
Chameleon Epidermis.

#### Complete Wing Development 

The form of fleshy membranes, feathery wings, bat-like extremities, or
even scaly or insect-like versions. With these wings the character can
fly with a movement of 120’. The mutant may fly while carrying only 25%
of his body weight. Creatures over 150 pounds cannot use these wings for
flight, but they leap to a distance of 120’, with a maximum height of
80’.

#### Density Alteration 

This mutation grants the ability to instantly alter body density, thus
shrinking or enlarging, with maximum enlargement up to twice the natural
body size, and maximum shrinkage to 1/8 original body size. Each
fraction of a body size change is accompanied by an equal fraction
increase or decrease to armor class and speed. For example, reduction of
size by 1/4 also reduces (improves) armor class and reduces movement by
1/4. Becoming twice as large increases armor class by a multiple of two
(to a maximum of 9) and doubles movement. Note that reduction of body
density to 1/8 makes a character impervious to damage from sharp
implements.

#### Dermal Poison Slime 

The mutant is covered in a thick gooey slime (like a frog) that is
poisonous to those who touch or attempt to ingest the mutant. Roll on
the poison table (see Adventuring Rules) at character creation for the
class of the poison in the slime. Successful bare-hand attacks and bite
attacks against the mutant require the attacker to attempt a saving
throw versus poison. Bare-hand attacks made by the mutant have the same
effect.

#### Dual Headed 

> The mutant has developed a second head next to the first. He can only
> be surprised on a roll of 1 on 1d6. Roll one die for each head
> whenever using senses (listening, looking for traps), choosing the
> best result.

#### Dwarfism 

> Mutated genes have altered the mutant’s physical size, an effect
> either related to a pituitary defect or a change in the genetic
> program during the years of body growth and development. With this
> mutation, the mutant is a dwarf, a mutant with substantially decreased
> size and body weight.

To figure out the character’s size, start with a base of 6 feet. Roll
1d4+1 and subtract the result from 6 to get the height of the character
in feet. This will give a range from 1 and 4 feet.

The character’s diminutive size makes it harder to damage opponents, but
also makes it more difficult for opponents to land successful blows on
the mutant, since he presents such a small target. A dwarf mutant has a
+1 to hit targets of human sized or larger with a non-powered hand
weapon. He does -1 to damage for every 1’ shorter than he is from 3
feet, with an equal reduction (improvement) of AC for each foot he is
shorter than 3’.

#### Echolocation 

The mutant has the ability to gather information on his surroundings by
using a type of natural sonar. The mutant must emit a noise (some kind
of clicking or speech will do), which then reverberates off of the
surface of any surrounding objects or creatures, is picked up by an
external sense organ and translated into a rough, colorless picture of
all objects in the mutant’s surroundings. This allows the character to
interact with the surroundings as if he has sight, even if he does not
have eyes or regular sight is obscured. This does not allow the mutant
to see through objects, nor will it allow him to read text or see
pictures. This works for a range of 90 feet, or 270 feet if the
character also has the *increased hearing* mutation. Mutants with this
ability will have a better chance of striking an opponent, receiving a
+2 to hit in combat.

#### Energy Ray 

Every 3 rounds, this mutation grants the ability to emit a blast of
energy (roll 1d6; 1-2 heat, 3-4 cold, 5 radiation, 6 electricity) from
the hands (or other upper appendages) that inflicts 4d6 hit points of
damage to a distance of 50 feet. Only one type of energy may be chosen
at character creation.

#### Energy-Retaining Cell Structure 

The mutant’s body has a higher than normal level of electrical energy
coursing through his body, energy which he can focus into a shock
capable of damaging opponents who touch him. This electrical shock does
3d6 hp damage.

#### Epidermal Photosynthesis 

Characters with this mutation get energy from the sun, processing it
through their bodies as though it were food. If they spend long periods
of inactivity in direct sunlight, they will be able to heal wounds more
quickly (4x) than the regular healing rate (1d3 per day of complete
rest). When they are out of the sun (i.e. at night or in a dark cave)
they are forced to move more slowly in order to conserve their rapidly
depleting energy. This reduces their movement to 50% of the normal rate.
Such characters are also more susceptible to cold and heat, and they
suffer a –2 penalty to saving throws versus cold or heat based energy
attacks.

#### Fragrance Development 

The mutant has the ability to produce a subtle yet hypnotic fragrance.
The fragrance is generally derived from mutated pheromones/hormones
(that are emitted at the mutant’s will), but could come in another
form-spores, for instance. Once per day the mutant can emit a scent that
forces up to 8 HD of creatures, or any single creature with less than 13
HD (or 13 CON) within 15 feet to save versus poison or fall into a
hypnotic trance for 2d4 rounds. Victims may be ordered to commit any act
that is not suicidal, up to and including attacking friends.

#### Gigantism 

Mutated genes have altered the mutant’s physical size, an effect either
related to a pituitary defect or a change in the genetic program during
the years of body growth and development. While this serves to increase
strength and size potential substantially, the mutant is nonetheless
noticeably different than others of his species.

The original size is based on a 6 foot height. Roll 3d6, adding that
many feet to the size of the mutant, achieving sizes between 9 and 24
feet. The mutant gets a bonus to damage, based on his height. Note that
all mutants with gigantism suffer a -1 penalty to hit creatures 3’ tall
or smaller.

##### Gigantism Modifiers 

> 9’ 12’ 18’ 24’ <u>Damage Dice Bonus\* +1 +2 +3 +4</u>

\*The Damage Dice Bonus is only applicable to non-powered hand weapons.

#### Increased Balance 

The character will never fall or stumble, and can climb almost any
surface without being in danger of losing balance.

#### Increased Physical Attribute \[Strength, Dexterity, Constitution\] 

One or more physical attributes is increased. Roll 1d6 to determine the
specific effects.

1-2 *Increased Strength:* The character can summon bursts of great
strength, dealing an extra 3d6 when damaging an opponent with a
hand-to-hand weapon.

3-4 *Increased Dexterity:* The character’s AC is adjusted by –2. This
bonus is cumulative with any other DEX bonuses.

5-6 *Increased Constitution:* The character receives Constitution x2 in
extra hit points, and receives +2 to all saving throws versus poison.

#### Increased Sense \[Touch, Taste, Sight, Hearing, Smell\]

One or more senses is very acute, allowing the mutant to sense things
others may not. Roll 1d10 to determine the sense.

1-2 *Increased Vision:* This allows the mutant to see things as far as 3
miles away if there is a clear line of sight. This mutation comes with
the benefit of *ultraviolet vision* and *night vision*.

3-4 *Increased Hearing:* A character may distinguish even the quietest
sounds at a range of 180 feet. This also allows the mutant to pick out
sounds from a jumble of noises. Mutants with *increased hearing* cannot
be surprised because they will always hear any movement in their
vicinity, and they can listen at a door with success on a roll of 1-5 on
1d6.

5-6 *Increased Smell:* A mutant with this mutation can pick up scents at
180 feet and tell the difference between various smells even if some
seem overwhelming to others. Creatures that are upwind can never
surprise this character.

7-8 *Increased Touch:* This increased sense grants +10% to technology
rolls.

9-10 *Increased Taste:* This ability does not have a range, but it
ensures that a character cannot be poisoned and will always be able to
tell by tasting whether something is capable of being eaten for
nourishment.

#### Metamorph

The character can choose (at character creation) another creature that
he or she can transform into. The character does not gain the mutations
of the creature, just the physical appearance and natural abilities
(such as claws or sharp teeth). This physical change (in either
direction) takes 2 full rounds of inactivity before it is complete.

#### Natural Armor 

This mutation indicates that the character has grown a natural defense
mechanism over the entire body. It can be thick fur, scales, a shell, or
even rubbery skin. This armor is moderate (1-3 on 1d6) or extreme (4-6
on 1d6). Moderate armor grants an AC of 6, while extreme natural armor
grants an AC of 4, but reduces movement to 75% of its regular rate.

#### Night Vision

Individuals with this mutation can see in complete darkness to a range
of 60 feet by utilizing minute amounts of available light. Vision is in
black and white only, and does not function in utter darkness
underground, since some small light must be present (starlight,
moonlight), even if it is so dim normal sight does not perceive it.

#### Optic Emissions 

This mutation takes two forms. Roll 1d6, and on a roll of 1-3 the mutant
character receives the ability to project a flash of very bright light
from the eyes (*bright eyes*), blinding an opponent within 30’ for 1d4
rounds. This blindness causes the opponent a penalty of -4 to attack
rolls and increases his armor class by 4. This ability is useful
regardless of daytime or nighttime. On a roll of 4-6, the character has
the ability to discharge a burst of radiation from the eyes (*gamma
eyes*), that can reach 30’. Damage is determined at character creation
by rolling for the class of the radiation on the radiation table in the
Adventuring section.

#### Parasitic Control 

If the character can attack and latch onto another creature for 3
rounds, he or she will maintain control over the creature as long as the
two are in physical contact.

#### Prehensile Tail 

The mutant has developed a special tail. The tail is not necessarily a
balancing tool, but more of an “additional limb”.

The tail can grapple objects like a hand (much like a new world monkey’s
tail), allowing the mutant to hang from tree limbs, for instance,
leaving the arms and legs free to perform other actions of a more
complex and agile nature. Some typical bonuses granted by the mutation
might be a +2 bonus to Dexterity checks when climbing or balancing (+4
if climbing trees), etc. The tail can also be used in more mundane ways,
such as holding a light source, so the character can employ both hands
to fight. The tail cannot use weapons or hold a shield, however, as it
is not quite that dexterous.

#### Quickness 

This mutation makes the mutant much quicker in all respects. Movement
speed is doubled, mental tasks take half as long to accomplish, and the
character may attack two times per round in physical combat (not mental
combat).

#### Reflective Epidermis 

The character’s skin is essentially impenetrable to a particular form of
energy. At character creation, roll 1d8. A roll result of 1-2 is
electricity, 3-4 is heat, 5-6 is cold, and 7-8 is radiation. The mutant
will never suffer damage from this energy source.

#### Regenerative Capability 

When provided with proper rest and food, this mutation allows the
character to recuperate from injury at a staggering rate. Given time,
mutants may re-grow severed limbs.

The character heals 10 extra hit points per day. If he should be so
unfortunate as to lose a limb or extremity (and survive), the lost body
part will regenerate over a period of 1d4+2 weeks. A head may never be
regrown, and characters do not regenerate from death.

#### Shriek 

The mutant’s vocal cords are substantially altered, allowing him to
produce sounds both above and below the normal human auditory range. The
culmination of this ability seems to be a focused shout, using the sonic
vibrations on everyone in the immediate vicinity of the mutant.

Once per day, the mutant can let out a horrible shriek that affects
everyone within a 10’ radius of him. Targets in the area of effect must
save versus stun attacks or take 1d4 points of sonic damage and be
deafened for 1d6+4 rounds. Those who successfully save are unaffected.
Mutants with the mutation *echolocation* suffer a -2 penalty to save.

#### Spiny Growth 

Parts of the mutant’s body are covered with prickly spines, which may be
small, medium, or large. Roll 1d6 at character generation to determine
the size. Small spines (1-2) inflict 1d4 damage, medium spines (3-4)
inflict 1d6, and large spines (5-6) are capable of inflicting 1d8
damage. Any type can be removed and thrown as a dagger. With a little
effort, the small spines are capable of being hidden beneath normal
clothing, but the medium and large spines are virtually impossible to
conceal because of their size.

#### Thermal Vision 

The character can see the heat generated by living beings, heat-emitting
weapons, or other natural heat sources. This vision functions to a
distance of 60’ if the mutant has ordinary vision as well, or to 90’ if
thermal vision is the only form of sight the mutant possesses (the eyes
emit infrared radiation to boost the distance). If a mutant has ordinary
vision and thermal vision, the thermal vision is only usable in
darkness, and it takes 1 round to transition between them. Immense
flashes of heat or those coming from close proximity to the character
can be overwhelming, blinding the character for 2d4 rounds.

#### Toxic Weapon 

The character is endowed with a weapon that is toxic to those affected
by it. This could be in the form of a gas that affects everyone in a
specific radius, a spray that can affect a specific target, or a
bite/sting that affects a target at a range of touch. Some common types
of toxic weapons are paralyzing venoms, blinding gasses or sprays, and
acidic bodily fluids. The range or radius of the attack is up to 30’.
Any kind of poison must be rolled on the poison table in the Adventuring
section to determine poison class at character generation, or
alternative effects may be designed with the ML. In general, no attack
should exceed 10d6 in damage (with the exception of poisons that may
inflict death).

#### Ultraviolet Vision 

The character can see the UV spectrum and will be able to see objects
that emit this type of energy. This spectrum includes gamma radiation,
x-rays, and other high intensity radiation. As a result, a character
with this vision can see if areas have a high level of background
radiation. At night, this vision allows a character to see to a distance
of 300’. Since this vision relies on heavy background radiation, it is
not useful underground unless there is a source of radiation for
illumination. If a mutant has ordinary vision and *ultraviolet vision*,
the *ultraviolet vision* is only usable in darkness, and it takes 1
round to transition between each form.

#### Unique Sense 

The mutant with a unique sense may detect certain kinds of phenomenon
that are not detectable by the usual senses. These might include the
ability to “feel” radiation to a distance of 60’, “smell” water within a
mile, or sense when certain kinds of weather are imminent. The player
and Mutant Lord may devise an appropriate sense, and what its range will
be. Some senses may have corresponding new organs.

### Physical Mutation Drawbacks 

#### Albinism 

This mutation prevents the formation of melanin. The mutant’s hair and
skin are bone white, and his eyes have light pink irises. Due to the
lack of pigment in the eyes, the being is highly sensitive to light, and
suffers a –2 penalty to hit when in daylight.

#### Bizarre Appearance 

This mutation can take a number of forms. The character’s hair color,
eye color, skin color (or any combination) can be a color not normally
found in humans. Odd hair colors might be light red, unusually fair
blond, white, platinum, or silvery gray. Skin hues might include
extensive freckling, melanin blotches, irregularly livid tones, etc. Eye
colors could be red, pink, white, unusual flecked combinations etc.
Other mutations are possible, such as scales instead of skin, general
cosmetic deformity, or general animal-like deformity. Whatever the
abnormal condition, it is clear that the character is not a normal human
or animal.

#### Epidermal Susceptibility 

The epidermis of the mutant becomes defective in some way, either
causing 1d6 hp of damage for coming into contact with usually harmless
substances (such as water), or adding +1 per die of damage caused by
specific injury, such as by fire, radiation, slashing weapons, or
penetrating weapons.

The mutation can also be something that constantly creates a serious
inconvenience for the character, such as glowing skin, uncontrollable
pigment shifting, or skin that always attracts certain kinds of vermin
or larger creatures.

#### Frailty

This is a highly variable mutation, and can be used to create any number
of body weaknesses. Examples include brittle bones or susceptibility to
bruising. These would increase damage by falls or other blunt force
trauma by a degree decided on by the ML. However, damage should usually
be increased no more than by +3 per die of damage.

#### Hemophilia 

The mutant’s white blood cells are diminished in count, preventing him
from healing as quickly as a normal specimen of his kind. This mutant
may only heal 1d3 hp every other day. Once the character is injured, he
begins to bleed profusely, losing 2 hit points per round until the
wounds can be properly bandaged.

#### Increased Caloric Needs 

This drawback requires the character to eat twice the normal amount of
food daily. During times of vigorous activity, this need becomes more
acute. For every 5 rounds of vigorous activity, the character must eat
for 1 round or lose 2 hit points and 1 point of STR each melee round
until he eats again or until the activity stops. All losses will be
regained at an equal rate for each round that food is consumed, until
all loss of hit points and STR is regained.

#### Obese 

The character suffers from obesity, and his weight is twice that of an
average individual of his species. The ML may apply encumbrance or
combat modifiers when it seems as though the character’s size would
interfere with his abilities in any way. It is also possible to choose
one body location and declare that the fat accumulates there, giving one
or more limbs a grotesque, bloated shape compared to that of the rest of
the body.

#### Pain Insensitivity 

The character lacks the awareness that living creatures normally possess
with regard to their bodies and immediate surroundings. The character
does not feel pain when injured, even if a weapon has penetrated his
body. The character will not be able to tell how much damage he has
sustained without making a visual checkup of his entire body. The ML
should keep track of the character’s hit points.

#### Pain Sensitivity 

The character’s nervous system is very susceptible to injury, resulting
in all damage to the character being doubled.

#### Pituitary Deformation 

This defect indicates the pituitary gland of the mutant has been
deformed by mutation, causing unnatural aging.

A character with this defect appears much older than he really is,
generally two to three times his actual age. Lifespan is also hindered
by this deformation, resulting in a maximum natural lifespan of 40-50
years.

#### Poison Susceptibility 

This mutation makes all poisons much more dangerous to the character.
All saving throws versus poison are made with a penalty of -4.

#### Prey Scent 

The mutant’s body sends out waves of scent that will attract predators.
The ML may increase the occurrence of wandering monsters, at his
discretion.

#### Reduced Immune System 

Whenever the character falls ill, whether it is from infection caused by
combat/misadventure, or airborne infectious diseases, the character
suffers an extra 10 hp of damage per day. If using the optional Disease
rules characters with this mutation suffer a -4 saving throw adjustment
against diseases, and the duration is doubled.

#### Reduced Oxygen Efficiency 

This mutation makes it harder for the character to get oxygen into the
circulatory system. This means that, after any amount of extended
physical activity (including combat) lasting more than 5 rounds, the
character must rest or fall unconscious for 3d6 rounds. Further, when
exploring ruins these characters need to rest for 1 turn after 3 turns
of exploration. See “Rest” in the Adventuring Rules section.

#### Sensory Deficiency 

This mutation indicates that the character suffers from either blindness
or deafness (50%).

#### Simian Deformity 

A mutant who suffers from this mutation has an altered appearance that
mimics that of the great apes (such as gorillas and chimpanzees) -
shorter legs, quadrupedal, and elongated arms that permit the knuckles
to touch the ground and aid in movement.

The character’s shortened legs reduce his base speed to 2/3 normal.
However, if all 4 limbs are used to move (arms and legs), his speed is
normal. A character using his arms to assist movement cannot be wielding
a weapon or carrying items in his hands.

#### Slow Mutant 

This mutation makes the mutant much slower in all respects. Movement
speed is halved, mental tasks take twice as long to accomplish, and the
character may attack once every other round.

#### Vision Impairment 

This mutation covers all visual impairments that fall short of total
blindness, including macular degeneration, myopia, severe light
sensitivity, cataracts, etc. This condition makes it extremely difficult
for the mutant to discern objects more than 50 feet away. Characters
with this mutation have a -2 to hit in combat.

### Mental Beneficial Mutations 

#### Ability Boost 

Once per day the mutant is capable of concentrating his mental energy to
such a degree that one of his abilities is doubled for 1d10 consecutive
rounds, or he gains +1 to attack rolls for 1d10 rounds. The character
may choose either of these options each time the mutation is used.

#### Accumulated Resistance 

Through years of exposure to a certain substance (chemicals or
radiation, for instance), or concentrated form of energy (such as heat,
cold, or light) in the mutant’s environment, a resistance against said
source has been accumulated, allowing the mutant to take more damage
from one of these sources.

This mutation gives the mutant a hit point reserve equal to his total
hit points. This hit point reserve is used to take damage from the
substance he is resistant to before it begins to affect his regular pool
of hit points. This separate pool heals in the same manner and at the
same time as the character’s hit point pool, even if that rate is
changed by other mutations such as *acute hyper healing* or *body
adjustment*.

#### Acute Hyper Healing 

The character may concentrate his mental energies to allow him to heal
4x the normal rate. He will also be free from physical pain and fatigue
for up to 24 hours. This power may be used once per week.

#### Ancestral Form 

This mental mutation can reduce an opponent’s mutational capabilities,
eventually removing all forms of mutation and returning it to its
original, unadulterated form. On each round after a successful mental
attack with this mutation, the target has one mutation removed
permanently (randomly determined), until none are left. Rarely (5%),
this power allows a powerful mutant to regress a pure specimen further
down the evolutionary line, to a previous stage of its evolution. For
example, a pure human might become a dimmer-witted *Homo erectus*, and
onward. This attack may only be attempted for the duration of one
encounter, whether it succeeds or not, and cannot be used again for 1
week.

#### Body Adjustment 

The character can heal all of his hit points once every 24 hours. In
addition, if the character is in a life or death situation, this
mutation can double his physical attributes (Strength, Dexterity,
movement) for 3d10 rounds.

This power may only be used 1d4 times per week (roll at character
creation).

#### Combat Empathy 

The character is so attuned to the minute body language of others that
he can tell what they are going to do before they do it. This gives him
a +1 to hit in combat, and +3 hp damage per damage die rolled in a
successful attack.

#### Control Light Waves 

The character can control light, creating a number of interesting
effects. He can bend light around himself, becoming invisible, or he may
remove all light from a small area (10’ radius) at a range of 30 feet.
He may also completely dissipate laser fire anywhere within this 30’
range. All of these effects require concentration, such that the mutant
may move at full speed but not attack when concentrating on using this
mutation.

#### Control Weather 

The mutant can change the weather in the local area. It takes 1 round to
use the mutation and an additional 1d4 rounds for the effects to
manifest. The mutant calls forth weather appropriate to the climate and
season of the area.

Season Possible Weather

Spring Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather

Summer Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm

Autumn Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet

Winter Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw

Late winter Hurricane-force winds or early spring (coastal area)

The mutant controls the general tendencies of the weather, such as the
direction and intensity of the wind, but cannot control specific
applications of the weather-where lightning strikes, for example, or the
exact path of a tornado. Contradictory weather conditions are not
possible simultaneously. Control weather can do away with atmospheric
phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.

#### Damage Turning 

This mutation allows the character to return any incoming damage to the
origin of the attack. For this power to work the mutant must use every
bit of his concentration, taking no other actions. Any movement of

more than one or two small steps will cause this power to fail.

The power gradually builds up, allowing 3d6 hp worth of damage to be
turned the first round. This increases by 1d6 per round up to a maximum
of 20d6 hp worth of damage. The mutant only takes damage that is above
his current hp level of damage turning. For instance, in the first round
the character rolls 3d6, with a result of 14. He may turn up to 14 hp of
damage the first round. The next round he adds 1d6 to the current
running total of 14. He can keep the power working as long as he remains
still and concentrating, and he may maintain concentration when he
receives damage. The mutant cannot turn attacks that cause no damage. If
such powers are successful, they can interfere with this ability.

#### Density Alteration (Others) 

This mutation grants the ability to instantly alter the body density of
a target, thus shrinking or enlarging, with maximum enlargement up to
twice the natural body size. Each fraction of a body size change is
accompanied by an equal fraction increase or decrease to armor class and
speed. For example, reduction of size by 1/4 also reduces (improves)
armor class and movement by 1/4. Becoming twice as large increases armor
class by a multiple of two (to a maximum of 10) and divides movement in
half as well. Note that reduction of body density to 1/8 makes a
character impervious to damage from sharp implements.

This mutation has a range of 90 feet, a duration of 1d4 turns, and
cannot be used on the mutant who wields it.

#### Disintegration 

With this powerful mutation, the mutant can completely destroy matter on
a molecular level. Doing so requires so much energy expenditure,
however, that the mutant is instantly rendered unconscious, with 1 hp
left. The total weight that may be disintegrated is WILx10 pounds and
the range is 90 feet.

It is more difficult to disintegrate dense materials. Multiply the
mutant’s WIL by 3 to find the percentage chance of disintegrating metals
and stone, or by 5 to figure out the percentage chance of disintegrating
wood or living material.

Once the mutant has used this power, the ML must determine, via a secret
1d6 roll, how many days it will be before the power may be used another
time.

#### Dual Cerebellum 

The character has 2 fully functional brains that work in concert. The
mutant receives a bonus of 10% to all technology rolls, and the
character receives one extra random mental mutation that belongs to the
extra brain. Both brains have identical WIL. Having two brains also
helps to protect the mutant from mental attacks. Whenever the character
is the subject of a mental attack, the attacker must successfully attack
each brain.

Note that a character with two brains may or may not have two heads. One
brain may be located in an unexpected part of the body, or as part of a
small, sickly or undeveloped conjoined twin.

#### Empathy

The character can attune himself to the emotions of other beings and is
capable of instilling emotions in creatures who are successfully
attacked with this mutation. This mutation has a range of 90 feet.

#### Flight, Psionic 

The character may fly through the air with a movement of up to WIL x 10.
Any encumbrance will hinder the movement by reducing the speed at a
level set by the ML.

#### Force Screen 

This mutation allows the character to create an invisible field of
energy that is difficult to penetrate. The force screen is close to the
mutant’s body, extending only a few inches from his skin. It is capable
of taking 5d6 hp worth of damage (the ML determines this secretly each
time the power is used) before it collapses, leaving the mutant
unprotected. The power may only be used once per day.

#### Force Screen, Greater 

This force screen can be used at a range of 4’, and is capable of
enclosing other creatures. It can take 5d6 hp worth of damage before it
collapses (the ML determines this secretly each time the power is used),
and can be used once per day. It can also be employed in the same manner
as the regular force screen.

#### Increased Willpower 

The mutant gains 4 points to his WIL, and gains a bonus of 10% to
technology rolls.

#### Intellectual Affinity 

Thanks to advanced thinking capabilities, the mutant gains one of the
following abilities (roll 1d6):

1-2 *Martial Affinity:* +4 to hit in combat and +1d6 damage.

3-4 *Tinkerer Affinity:* Bonus of 20% to technology rolls. The character
may also make weapons that do extra damage, up to +4. These weapons take
extra long to build.

5-6 *Bartering Affinity:* +3 Charisma when trying to sell an object, and
any object sold will yield up to a multiple of 1d4+1 in profits if the
person being bartered with can afford it.

#### Killing Sphere 

This powerful mutation allows the mutant to generate a 25’ radius sphere
of deadly mental energy centered on the mutant. Within this sphere of
energy all creatures except the mutant (friend or foe!) have their hit
points reduced to 1 point, and must save versus stun attacks or be
knocked unconscious for 1d10 rounds. After using this mutation, the
mutant is exhausted from the force of the mental exertion and may move
at full rate but not attack for 2d10 rounds.

#### Know Direction 

The character is incapable of being lost, even if all other senses are
somehow nullified. He will always be able to find a location where he
has been previously, and will know its relation to any location in which
he currently resides.

#### Mental Barrier 

Any mental attacks against this mutant receive a –4 penalty to their
attack roll. A character with this mutation gains the ability to sense
other creatures that have mental mutations at a range of 90 feet. This
secondary ability does not require a roll.

#### Mental Phantasm 

With this power, the mutant is capable of creating a realistic, illusory
environment in the mind of another conscious creature. These visions are
realistic to all senses but touch. Once the target tries to make
physical contact with any element of the phantasm it dissolves into
reality.

#### Metaconcert 

This ability allows the mutant to link its mind with other mutants of a
similar type or those who have the same mental mutation. These include
those with the Metaconcert mutation, or other mental mutations that
facilitate control between the minds of two beings. The mutant may
combine his WIL with the WIL of other mutants for conducting a mental
attack, or some other joint purpose.

#### Mind Reflection 

The mutant may reflect any mental attack he experiences back at the
attacker, but he still suffers the effects of the attack. He may only
reflect a power that he has been successfully stricken by, and only as
many times as he has been stricken by it. The reflected power strikes
the mind of the attacker, and it can never target any other creature.

#### Mind Thrust 

The mutant is capable of firing a bolt of pure mental energy into the
mind of another creature, doing 3d6 hp damage at up to 50 feet. This
ability takes time to recharge, and can only be used once every two
rounds.

#### Neural Telekinesis 

With this mutation the character can lift or move WILx10 pounds using
only the power of his mind. This ability does not extend to lifting the
mutant, however. To the mutant, using this power feels like lifting the
object with his strength, and so requires some concentration. This
ability has a range of 50 feet, and can only be used to hold things for
5 rounds before the mutant becomes tired and must set the objects down.
The mutant must rest for 5 rounds before using the power again.

Any use of this mutation on another creature, or objects carried by
another creature, is considered a mental attack and must be handled
accordingly.

#### Neural Telepathy 

Using this ability, the mutant can connect his mind with another
creature’s mind and communicate directly, even if the two creatures
speak completely different languages or are of different species. The
range of this ability is 30 feet.

#### Plane Shift 

This mutation grants the power to visit realities in other dimensions.
These dimensions are accessed through temporary doors which the mutant
creates using the power of his mind. These doors appear as large portals
10’x10’ in size, and will last for 6 rounds or until the mutant closes
them intentionally. Once entered, they cannot be exited without a mutant
with this ability opening another door. The mutant can only choose to
open doors to worlds he has visited before. Otherwise, the doorway leads
to a random world of the ML’s choice and design. This ability only works
once per week.

#### Possession 

The mutant may wrest control over another creature’s body, subjecting
himself to all of the sensations the possessed creature experiences. If
the creature dies while possessed, the mutant dies as well. During the
time he possesses another body, the body of the mutant is unconscious
and vulnerable to attack. He may relinquish control of the body at any
time, and will return instantly to his own body.

This power works at a range of 50 feet, but once inside another body the
possessor can travel any distance with no ill effects.

#### Precognition 

The mutant is capable of seeing up to 3 minutes into the future, but
only with respect to dangerous things that will affect him. If the
future indicates that he is going to suffer some form of damage, he
immediately suffers 1d6 hp damage. If he is confronted with a vision of
his death or of suffering a grievous wound that would take more than ½
of his hit points, he suffers 2d6 hp damage and immediately enters a
comatose state lasting 1 turn.

#### Quick Mind 

The mutant is capable of learning how to use technology at a much higher
rate of speed than other characters (in 1/3 the time), and receives a
bonus of 30% to technology rolls. When confronted with a mental attack,
an attacker must roll to attack three times, succeeding each time (roll
three times for the one attack). Because of his incredible leaps of
logic, a mutant with this ability has a 100% chance of figuring out
whether someone is telling the truth.

#### Teleport

This ability allows the mutant to disappear from one location and appear
in a location up to 20 miles distant without physically crossing the
intervening space. If the mutant has never been to the location he is
teleporting to or is only slightly familiar with it (ML’s discretion) he
has a 25% chance of suffering 10d6 damage upon arrival as he teleports
into a space occupied by another object, or misjudges some aspect of the
location. If he is intimately familiar with his destination or has spent
2d4 hours conjuring an image of the location in his mind he can teleport
safely.

#### Temperature Control 

With this mutation, the character can raise or lower the temperature of
a visible object within a range of 90 feet. The specific form of the
power must be determined at character generation (50% heat, 50% cold).
The mental nature of this mutation requires concentration, and the
effect is a graduated level of damage equaling 1d6 per round. The
maximum amount of damage that can be dealt is 10d6 per round. The ML
will decide when an object or being combusts or freezes completely.

#### Vampiric Field 

This mutation grants the mutant the ability to absorb the life essence
(hit points) from all creatures (friend or foe) within a foot radius
equal to 30+WIL. This power absorbs 2d4 hp per round from all creatures
in the radius, and these absorbed points go into a separate reserve for
the mutant. All damage to the mutant is taken from these reserved points
until they are gone; after this point the mutant’s regular hp begin to
be affected. Stored hp will disappear after 24 hours.

### Mental Mutation Drawbacks 

#### Atrophied Cerebellum 

The mutant’s brain has atrophied in certain areas due to a genetic birth
defect. As a result of this mutation, the mutant suffers a one-time –2
reduction of INT and DEX, due to deterioration in mental capacity and
coordination.

#### Dual Cerebellum (Defective) 

The character has a second brain that hinders his thought processes.
This brain has 1d4 mental mutations of its own (half of which should be
defects, round up), which should be kept secret from the player until an
opportunity to discover them comes about during play. This second brain
may have an entirely different personality and motives than the
character, and may try to foil the character’s actions at inconvenient
times. This is up to the ML’s discretion. This “Hyde” brain may attempt
to take over the mutant’s body, as the mutation *possession*, once per
month for a duration of 24 hours.

#### Mind Reflection (Defective) 

This defect creates a chance that mental attacks attempted by the mutant
backfire, causing injury to him instead of his enemy. The chance of this
occurring is 25%.

In the case of powers that inflict no damage, the Mutant Lord should
find some way to make the power backfire or become an inconvenience to
the character.

#### Negative Empathy 

The mutant sends out waves of negative mental energy, causing *anyone*
with less than 17 Intelligence within a 90’ radius to have a 15%
probability of attacking the mutant. Only one check is necessary per
person until they leave the field and reenter it.

#### Phantasmal Damage 

When the mutant is damaged, his mind radiates waves of negative energy
in a feedback loop through his nervous system that causes the effective
damage from an attack to be doubled.

#### Phobia 

The mutant has an irrational fear of some creature or object. Whenever
he comes face to face with the object of his fear, he flees immediately,
throwing anything in his hands at the feared object/creature in an
effort to distract or harm it. He will flee in the opposite direction at
full movement for 1d4 rounds.

Roll 1d6 to find out what category his fear falls into. The ML will
flesh out the specifics.

1.  Other technological (robots, vehicles)

2.  Weaponry (energy weapons, other)

3.  Animal

4.  Plant

5.  Ordinary object

6.  Insect

#### Weak Will 

The WIL of the mutant is reduced to 3.

### Plant Beneficial Mutations 

#### Abnormal Size 

The plant is either much larger than normal or much smaller than the
average specimen. Roll 1d20 and multiply or divide the plant’s normal
size by that number to arrive at the new abnormal size. See *dwarfism*
and *gigantism* for potential size effects on combat.

#### Accumulated Resistance 

With this mutation, the plant has learned to change its structure to
gain complete immunity to any energy-based attack that it has
experienced in the past, including heat, cold, electricity, radiation,
or energy weapons.

#### Animal Limbs or Organs 

This mutation gives the plant any kind of organs or limbs normally found
in humans or animals. The player and Mutant Lord will determine the
exact nature of the new limbs or organs.

#### Animate Seeds 

This mutation allows the seeds of a plant to maneuver once away from the
plant. The seeds can have their own plant mutations, but will grow up to
have the same mutations as the adult plant that spawned them.

#### Carnivore 

The plant has mouths that are capable of inflicting 1d8 damage with a
bite. Roll 1d12 to determine how many mouths are on the plant.

#### Chameleon Metamorph 

The plant can change color or shape in order to look like any other kind
of plant, but the mass of the plant is unchanged. If the plant has a
level of intelligence it can alter the color to benefit it in other ways
as well (see *chameleon epidermis*).

#### Dermal Acid Sap 

The plant’s sap is a concentrated acid that will inflict 3d6 hp damage
every round to creatures that come in contact with it.

#### Dermal Poison Sap 

The sap of the plant is poisonous to creatures that come in contact with
it or ingest it. The poison effects should be determined with a roll on
the poison table.

#### Electric Charge Generation 

The plant can use some of the excess energy not converted to food into a
stored electrical charge capable of damaging creatures that come in
contact with it. This electrical weapon does 4d6 hp damage, and must be
recharged. The plant will be fully charged again after four rounds, and
may deliver smaller shocks (non-damaging, but uncomfortable) every round
if under constant harassment by predators or opponents.

#### Flight 

The plant has developed some way of coasting on strong winds and, if the
plant is intelligent, it may have actual winged flight. The method of
flight is up to the ML. Perhaps the plant has grown special cupped
leaves or a series of light tubules that make it structurally capable of
flight. For winged flight by modified leaves, see *complete wing
development* for movement. Otherwise, the plant’s movement rate will be
heavily dependent on wind speeds.

#### Fragrance Development (Plants) 

The plant can send out a scent that is enticing to all living creatures.
This scent can be smelled for a range of up to 5 miles in windy
conditions, or 90 feet in regular conditions.

The enticing scent overwhelms any creature that fails a saving throw
versus poison. Every creature so enticed will stay as close to the plant
as possible and try to protect it, even to the point of fighting other
creatures that draw near. Every 5 rounds anyone enticed by the plant’s
fragrance may make another saving throw. Until the victim is successful,
he will stay near the plant until he dies from severe dehydration or
starvation.

The scent itself deals no damage, but the plant may have other mutations
capable of doing so.

#### Free Movement 

The plant is capable of maneuvering on its own at standard movement.
This may be through the use of leglike protrusions or by pulling itself
along the ground with vines or other branches.

#### Full Senses 

The plant is capable of utilizing one or more human senses, or other
senses such as *sonar*, *thermal vision* or other unusual senses. It is
up to the player and Mutant Lord to determine how the plant uses them.
If this mutation is rolled more than once, one or more of the acquired
senses may become increased as per the *increased senses* physical
mutation.

#### Grenade-Like Fruit 

Plants with this mutation have pods that are explosive and deal 2d6 hp
damage to creatures within 10’. Upon exploding, the pod may also release
radiation (50%) of a randomly determined class. The range for this
mutation varies based on the size of the plant, and whether or not it is
capable of moving under its own power. If the plant is incapable of
movement, the pods simply drop near the base. If the plant is small
(1’-2’), there is a 25% chance a dropped pod will explode. If it is a
medium sized plant (3’5’) there is a 45% chance, and if it is a
tree-sized plant (6 ft. or beyond), there is an 80% chance of detonation
when dropped. Extremely tall plants may have a 100% chance, or the ML
may declare that any size plant has a higher chance because of the
chemical makeup of the pods.

Plants that are capable of movement can throw their own pods at a range
determined by multiplying the plant’s height x 10 feet.

#### Injected Poison Sap 

The plant has a toxic sap that is injected when the plant’s branches or
vines are stepped on or otherwise blundered into. A PC with this
mutation may use this as an attack each round. The class of the poison
is determined randomly.

#### Natural Armor (Plant) 

The plant has developed a thicker skin or shell that provides armor
against physical attacks. In all other ways this mutation resembles
*natural armor* from the human/animal mutations list.

#### Natural Vegetal Weapons 

This mutation covers all types of aspects of a plant that could
generally be considered “natural”. This includes things like large
thorns (up to 12 inches), or sharp leaves capable of cutting into flesh
or clothing. While dangerous on their own, these will generally only
affect characters that blunder into the plant unaware of its danger.
When such weapons are attached to plants that are capable of attacking
or moving their vines or limbs about, however, they become very
dangerous indeed.

The types of weapons covered by Natural Vegetal Weapons can do 1d4, 1d6,
or 1d8 damage. Determine randomly for PCs by rolling 1d6; 1-2 1d4; 3-4
1d6; 5-6 1d8. These weapons may have other effects decided by the ML.
They may be passive, or attached to mobile vines.

#### Poisonous Spores 

Whenever the plant is disturbed, it will emit a cloud of spores. These
spores can cause any effect the player and Mutant Lord wishes. The most
basic type of poisonous spore simply has a random class of poison, but
others may be hallucinogenic, paralytic, or allergy inducing. All will
allow a saving throw versus poison.

#### Prehensile Tendrils 

These plant growths are capable of movement and a rudimentary sense of
touch. Prehensile tendrils come in two forms, Simple and Constrictive.
Roll 1d6:

1-3 *Simple tendrils:* These have a randomly determined (3d6) DEX and
are capable of wielding weapons, but are not strong enough to do damage
on their own. Higher DEX scores are due to aspects of the plant that
make it more dexterous, like sticky fibers and clingy cilia.

4-6 *Constrictive Tendrils:* These tendrils can do 2d6 damage through
constriction and are capable of rapid movement. A successful attack roll
achieves constriction, and the victim will suffer damage on each
consecutive round.

Because the growth pattern of such plants dictates that the tendrils
grow to full size quickly, even small plants with this mutation are
considered to have tendrils at least 10’ long, and are capable of
growing their tendrils to any length the ML desires. To randomly
determine the length of the tendrils, simply multiply the base of 10’ by
a roll of: 1d6 for small plants, 1d10 for medium sized plants, or 1d20
for large or tree sized plants. PCs with this mutation may choose the
length of their tendrils, but the length should range from 10’ to 20’.

#### Projectile Thorns 

The plant is endowed with a substantial number of thorns. These thorns
are capable of being thrown if the plant has mobility and any level of
intelligence. The throwing range of these thorns is like a dagger, and
they deal 1d4 hp damage if they strike a creature. Some plants (50%)
grow thorns that are covered with toxins. Determine the class of the
poison randomly.

#### Radioactive Emissions 

The plant has become irradiated through mutation, and is capable of
giving off a randomly determined class of radiation at a range of 150’.
A good sized patch of these plants is capable of clearing a large area
of animals and other radiation sensitive creatures, and will often
become a safe haven for creatures that are immune to the effects of
radiation.

#### Reflective Cellular Structure 

The plant’s skin is essentially impenetrable to a randomly determined
form of energy. Roll 1d8; 1-2 electricity; 3-4 heat; 5-6 cold; 7-8
radiation.

#### Shriek (Plant) 

Whenever a plant with this mutation is damaged, it gives off a piercing
shriek that is capable of damaging everyone within a 30’ radius. This
strange attack does not harm other similar plants. The shriek causes 3d6
damage (save versus stun attacks for half), and may be used every 4
rounds until the plant is killed. Mutants with the *echolocation*
mutation suffer a -2 penalty to save. If a large patch of these plants
is injured all at once, such as when they are trampled by large
creatures or vehicles roll 3d10 for damage instead of 3d6. An
intelligent plant may use this ability every 4 rounds at will.

#### Thermal Emissions 

The plant is capable of generating a ray of heat or cold (50%) capable
of doing 4d6 damage to those it comes in contact with. Depending on the
size of the plant, it may have 1d3 heat or cold emitting flowers or
branches. The range of this attack is 50 feet. The ML may determine if
there is a difference between intelligent plants and other plants with
regard to this power. A suggested difference is a -2 attack adjustment
for plants with no higher order mental functions.

#### Tripping Tendrils 

These tendrils have a very low strength (1d4), and are capable of only
very slow movement. Given enough time, however, they can crush a small
or weakened creature in their grasp. Once in position, without
resistance, they may inflict 1d6 hp damage per round. The plant usually
grows a large patch (2d10 feet in diameter) of these vines to trip
victims. Victims who fall unconscious on vines such as these are not
likely to waken.

#### Vegetal Parasite 

If the plant can attack and latch onto another creature for 3 rounds
(one successful attack roll for three consecutive rounds), it will
maintain control over the creature as long as the two are in physical
contact. Plants will usually use these controlled bodies for protection
or food, and a plant may control as many creatures as it has limbs to
touch them.

### Plant Mutation Drawbacks 

#### Nocturnal

The plant is completely motionless during daylight hours. As soon as the
sun dips below the horizon or the plant is in full shadow for 1d4
rounds, however, it will begin to move or otherwise act if it is able.

#### Prey Scent 

The plant sends out waves of scent that attracts predators. In the case
of a mobile, intelligent PC plant, the ML may increase the chances of
encountering some types of monsters.

#### Reduced Fertility 

Very few of these plants will exist in one localized area. With human
intervention, this trait can be bred out of a plant type in a number of
generations through the application of advanced horticulture practices.

#### Thermal Sensitivity 

The plant is susceptible to heat or cold (50%). Such energy based
attacks deal 2 extra points per die of damage in addition to the regular
damage inflicted.

# CHAPTER 3: SKILLS

Characters in Märchen Engine games engage in a variety of activities,
using their various skills to accomplish the challenges that confront
them. Skills and their usage are described in this chapter.

## Skill Checks

Skill checks use the core task resolution system for the Märchen Engine
to resolve actions. Whenever your character attempts any action with a
chance of failure, roll 2D6, add any skill levels, the appropriate
characteristic score modifier, and your difficulty DM. If the result
equals or exceeds 8, the action succeeds. If the result is lower than 8,
the action fails. The basics of the task resolution system can be found
in the **Introduction** chapter, under **Die Rolls**.

### Task Description Format

Task descriptions can be formally written in a specific format, as
follows.

*Task Description*: Required Skill, Characteristic, Time Increment,
Difficulty.

**Task Description**: Describes the action of the task itself. In print,
this is often italicized to help it stand out.

**Required Skill**: The skill required for the task. Skill levels are
added as a positive DM to the check. Unskilled characters suffer a -3 DM
if they do not have this skill.

**Characteristic**: The characteristic modifier that is added to the
check.

**Time Increment**: The time range required to perform the task.

#### Informal Skill Check Descriptions

Skill checks are also informally written by Difficulty followed by
Required Skill throughout this System Reference Document. For example,
repairing damage on a starship in mid-combat might be a Very Difficult
(–4) Engineering task. When listed in this manner, the Referee gets to
choose an appropriate Characteristic to modify the skill check, as well
as the time increment involved, if it is not already obvious from
context.

### Untrained and Zero-Level Skills

Characters can perform some tasks without any training in a skill, using
only raw talent (defined by their characteristic scores), but skilled
characters tend to be better at such things. Unless the Referee says you
cannot, you can always attempt tasks involving that skill even if you
have no training in it.

If a character has no level in a skill, then he is untrained and will
suffer a –3 Dice Modifier when trying to use that skill.

If a character has zero level in a skill (Skill 0), then he is competent
in using that skill, but has little experience. He does not get any
bonus from his skill ranks when using that skill but at least he avoids
the penalty for being untrained.

### Going Faster or Slower

You can choose, before you roll, to move up or down one or two rows on
the Time Frames table. Moving up (reducing the time increment) gives you
a –1 DM for every row you move; moving down and increasing the time
taken gives you a +1 DM for every row you move. Your Referee will help
adjudicate any issues that might arise from a change in the time frame.

#### Table: Time Frames

| Time Frame      | Base Increment                                             |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1D6 seconds     | One second                                                 |
| 1D6 rounds      | One personal combat round (6 seconds)                      |
| 1D6 minutes     | One minute (60 seconds, or 10 personal combat rounds)      |
| 1D6 kiloseconds | One kilosecond (\~16.67 minutes, or one space combat turn) |
| 1D6 hours       | One hour (60 minutes)                                      |
| 1D6 days        | One day (24 hours)                                         |
| 1D6 weeks       | One week (7 days)                                          |
| 1D6 months      | One common month (30-31 days)                              |
| 1D6 quarter     | One quarter (3 common months)                              |

### Multiple Actions

A character can try to do two or more things at once, like firing a
spacecraft’s weapons while also flying, or disarming a bomb while hiding
from guards. For every extra thing that the character is doing, he
suffers a –2 DM to all skill checks.

### Local Law Level

Some tasks are impacted by a world’s local Law Level, as presented in
the Universal World Profile. For tasks that are impacted by the local
laws, rules and regulations, the usual difficulty for tasks can be found
in the Base Difficulty by Law Level table.

#### Table: Base Difficulty by Law Level

| Law Level | Difficulty            |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| 0         | Routine (DM+2)        |
| 1-3       | Average (DM+0)        |
| 4-6       | Difficult (DM-2)      |
| 7-9       | Very Difficult (DM-4) |
| 10+       | Formidable (DM-6)     |

## Available Skills List

## Skill Descriptions

This section describes each skill found in the Märchen Engine, including
its common uses. You may be able to use skills for tasks other than
those given here. The Referee sets the Difficulty and decides the
results in all cases.

### Admin

The character has experience with bureaucratic agencies, and understands
the requirements of dealing with and managing them. When attempting
tasks like avoiding police harassment, ensuring the prompt issuance of
licenses, approval of applications, avoidance of close inspection of
papers, etc., a successful Admin skill check (with a Difficulty based on
Base Difficulty by Law Level table), will provide a positive outcome to
the situation.

**Bureaucrats and Administrators**: Dealing with administrators and
bureaucrats is always a time consuming and tedious chore, which somehow
seems to play a common part in Märchen Engine adventures. No special
skills are needed to deal with bureaucrats, but characters with the
Admin (or Advocate) skill will be familiar with their ways and find the
task much smoother and easier.

The offer of a bribe and a Bribery skill check may also be attempted in
place of an ability or Admin or Advocate skill check. See the
**Bribery** skill description for more information.

### Advocate

The character is familiar with the general laws and regulations that
govern interstellar travel, commerce and relations. This skill does not
impart knowledge of the myriad of laws on each individual world, nor
does it allow the person to act as an attorney.

**Ship Inspections**: Typically, when a ship arrives at a new world, it
will be inspected by the port authorities to check for compliance with
all applicable laws and regulations. It is also not uncommon for patrol
ships to stop and board merchant and other ships while in deep space.
When such an inspection does occur, the character may make an Advocate
check (with a Difficulty based on Base Difficulty by Law Level table) to
be found in compliance and pass inspection. If there is anything illegal
on board, the character suffers a -2 DM to the check.

### Aircraft (Cascade Skill)

The various specialties of this skill cover different types of flying
vehicles. When this skill is received, the character must immediately
select one of the following: Grav Vehicle, Rotor Aircraft or Winged
Aircraft.

### Animals (Cascade Skill)

The various specialties of this skill cover different aspects of animal
handling. When this skill is received, the character must immediately
select one of the following: Farming, Riding, Survival, or Veterinary
Medicine.

### Archery

The character is skilled at using bows and crossbows for hunting or in
combat.

### Athletics

This skill covers physical fitness and training, similar to that of a
trained athlete. This includes acts requiring physical coordination,
such as climbing, juggling or throwing; acts of endurance, such as
long-distance running or hiking; and acts of strength, such as
weight-lifting or bodybuilding.

**Non-human species with Wings**: For non-human species with wings, this
skill is also used to reflect their ability to fly.

### Battle Dress

This skill permits the character to operate advanced battle armor, a
powered form of combat armor that enhances the wearer's capabilities in
various ways. Ground-based military forces, and numerous mercenaries,
are often trained in the basics of battle dress operation. This skill
also covers the ability to operate vehicles designed as mechanical
exoskeletons.

### Bay Weapons

The character is skilled at operating bay weapons on board a ship.

### Bludgeoning Weapons

The character is skilled at using bludgeoning weapons, such as clubs,
staffs and really big wrenches, in personal combat.

### Bribery

The character has experience in bribing petty and not-so petty officials
in order to circumvent regulations or ignore cumbersome laws. The amount
of a bribe is often based on the level of offense, as outlined in the
Bribery Checks By Offense table.

#### Table: Bribery Checks By Offense

| Offense                       | DM  | Minimum Bribe |
|-------------------------------|-----|---------------|
| Petty Crime or Infraction     | +2  | 1D6x₢10       |
| Misdemeanor, Minor Infraction | +0  | 1D6x₢50       |
| Serious Crime or Infraction   | -2  | 1D6x₢100      |
| Capital Crime or Infraction   | -4  | 1D6x₢500      |

If the bribe is less than the minimum bribe required, the attempt will
automatically fail. Characters may offer more than the minimum bribe
required and receive a +1 DM for each multiple of the bribe offered. If
the first offer is refused, a character may make a second attempt at
twice the previous value of the bribe. If both attempts are refused
(failed), the Referee should have the character make a Social Standing
check, with a Difficulty based on Base Difficulty by Law Level table. If
this also fails, the character will be brought up on charges of
attempted bribery.

For example, a character trying to bribe an official to ignore a minor
smuggling infraction would have to offer a minimum bribe of ₢200. If the
character offered ₢400 instead the character could gain a +1 DM on the
check. If ₢600 were offered, the character could gain a +2 DM, etc.

### Broker

A broker is skilled in locating suppliers and buyers, and facilitating
the purchase and resale of commercial goods, as per the **Trade and
Commerce** rules.

### Carousing

This skill reflects the interpersonal art of interacting and socializing
with others. The character is skilled in the art of small talk and
making others feel at ease in their presence in almost any social
situation, such as a party, ball, inauguration, bar hopping, etc.

### Comms

The character is trained in the use, repair, and maintenance of
communications and sensor devices. While anyone can press the button and
make a communicator function, this skill is necessary to understand why
the device does not work, or how to use the device for purposes other
than open transmission. When using sensors, this skill allows the
character to interpret the long-range data of a ship's sensors and
scanners. Skilled characters can boost an incoming or outgoing signal,
create or break a secure channel, detect signals and anomalies, hide or
piggyback on another signal, jam local communications, locate and assess
potential threats, and analyze complex sensor data.

### Computer

The character is skilled in the programming and operation of electronic
and fiber optic computers, both ground and shipboard models. Computers
can be found on any world with a TL of 8 or higher, becoming
exponentially more common at higher technology levels.

A character without at least some computer training might find himself
at disadvantage in the highly technical universe of science fiction.
Anyone with Computer-0 or better can perform the following without a
skill check: Log on to a Datanet, send and receive messages, search for
non-classified information, and retrieve data and files. More skilled
users can create or break data encryption; mine data effectively; create
or break data and network security protocols; and perform other general
programming tasks.

### Demolitions

This skill covers the use of demolition charges and other explosive
devices, including assembling or disarming bombs.

### Electronics

The character is practiced in installing, using, maintaining, repairing
and/or creating electronic devices and equipment. The character can
practice a trade and make a decent living, earning a paycheck for every
week of dedicated work. The character knows how to use the tools of the
trade, how to perform routine tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers,
and how to handle common problems.

and how to handle common problems. Engineering is particularly important
in diverting power to the Jump Drives for a successful transition into
Jump space.

### Farming

The character can grow and harvest crops and raise animals. This also
covers hydroponic farming and clone harvesting for food production, at
sufficiently high tech levels.

### Gambling

The individual is well informed on games of chance, and wise in their
play. He or she has an advantage over non-experts, and is generally
capable of winning when engaged in such games. Gambling, however, should
not be confused with general risk-taking.

**Non-Competitive Games**: These are games such as Slots, Roulette,
Blackjack, Keno, etc. These games are played strictly against the house
and the odds are pretty much constant, as are the payoff values. The
character chooses a game by its odds of winning (high, average, low,
small or remote) and places a bet. The Referee determines if the game is
rigged. The character then rolls their Gambling score. On a success, the
character receives the payoff amount based on the amount of their
initial bet. House always wins on a natural 2.

#### Table: Gambling by Odds of Winning

| Odds of Winning | DM  | Payoff | Maximum Bet |
|-----------------|-----|--------|-------------|
| Rigged          | -8  | Varies | Varies      |
| Remote          | -6  | 1:10   | ₢5,000      |
| Small           | -4  | 1:8    | ₢1,000      |
| Low             | -2  | 1:4    | ₢500        |
| Average         | +0  | 1:2    | ₢100        |
| High            | +2  | 2:3    | ₢50         |

**Competitive Games**: If playing against a group of other players, each
member of the game will make their Gambling skill check with the highest
roll taking the pot. A character may attempt to cheat during a game at
any time by stating his or her intent to cheat and making an extra
Gambling check. If any other player in the game makes a successful
opposing Gambling check against the character's attempt at cheating they
are caught red-handed. Otherwise the player has successfully cheated and
takes the pot. If more than one person attempts to cheat during the same
round of play, the person with the highest roll wins the pot.

### Grav Vehicle

This skill grants the ability to properly maneuver and perform basic,
routine maintenance on air/rafts and other vehicles that use gravitic
technology. Grav vehicles have theoretically perfect maneuverability and
can hover, but skill checks may be necessary when performing high-speed
aerobatics.

required to actually pilot or drive them. The character can practice a
trade and make a decent living, earning a paycheck for every week of
dedicated work. The character knows how to use the tools of the trade,
how to perform routine tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and
how to handle common problems.

### Jack-of-All-Trades (Jack o' Trades or JoT)

The Jack of All Trades skill works differently to other skills. It
reduces the unskilled penalty a character receives for not having the
appropriate skill by one for every level of Jack of All Trades. Jack of
All Trades cannot grant a skill bonus at higher levels.

### Leadership

The character possesses the ability to rally, inspire, organize and
direct team efforts to ensure the best cooperation and productivity
possible.

**Coordinating Effort**: Whenever a task requires one or more characters
to combine their efforts (i.e. Teamwork; each makes a skill or ability
check towards a common goal), the character gains a pool of points equal
to the Effect of the skill check (minimum of 1), which can be
distributed by the leader to individual team members as DMs (grant a +1
DM per point) on skill or ability checks made toward the common goal.

**Improving Initiative**: The Leadership skill can be used to increase
another character's Initiative. The character with Leadership makes a
Leadership check, and the target character's Initiative is increased by
the Effect of the check. Making a Leadership skill check is a
significant action.

### Linguistics

The character can read and write a different language for every level of
Linguistics they possess. All characters can speak and read their native
language without needing the Linguistics skill, and automated computer
translator programs mean that the Linguistics skill are not always
needed on other worlds. Having Linguistics-0 implies that the character
has a smattering of simple phrases in many languages. In addition,
Linguistics can be used to attempt to decipher the general meaning of a
preserved specimen of language, such as an inscription or a recorded
message.

### Liaison

The character is trained in the art of dealing with others, including
knowledge of proper protocols, manners of address, codes of conduct and
other information needed when dealing with a wide range of societal
types. Such a character is quite useful when attempting to negotiate a
particularly edgy deal, to convince the Duke's secretary to admit the
party into the Duke's presence, help settle a dispute between two
opposing groups, or other acts of negotiation and diplomacy.

**Influencing Others**: The character can change others' attitudes with
a successful check. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Liaison
checks to see who gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve cases
when two diplomats are engaged in negotiations.

## Gaining New Skill Levels during Game Play

A character’s Skill Total is calculated by summing the levels of each
skill (level zero skills count as zero). A character with Mechanics 1
and Slug Pistol 2 would have a Skill Total of 3.

To increase a skill, a character must train for a number of weeks equal
to his current Skill Total plus the desired level of the skill. So, to
advance from Piloting 2 to Piloting 3 with a current Skill Total of 3
would take (three, plus three) six weeks. A character may only train one
skill in a given week.

The Jack of all Trades skill cannot be learned.

# CHAPTER 3: PSIONICS

For characters in Märchen Engine campaigns, psionics covers a broad
category of mental disciplines and paranormal abilities originating from
the mind. Psionics are divided into five different categories, called
talents. These talents are: Awareness, Clairvoyance, Telekinesis,
Telepathy, and Teleportation. The contents of this Chapter are optional.
It is up to the individual Referee if psionics is even available, much
less how a character may acquire these talents.

## Psionic Strength

Psionics are powered by the Psionic Strength characteristic
(abbreviation Psi). This characteristic cannot be rolled or bought
during character creation without the Referee's permission. To determine
a character's Psionic Strength, roll 2D6 and subtract the number of
terms served by the character in any career (Psionic Strength diminishes
over time unless actively used).

Using a psionic talent costs a number of Psionic Strength points,
temporarily reducing the character's total. As the Characteristic DM for
all Psionic skill checks is determined by the characters' current
Psionic Strength total, it gets harder and harder to use powers as the
character's strength declines.

### Recovering Psionic Strength Points

Expended Psionic Strength points are recovered at the rate of one point
per hour, beginning three hours after the character last used a psionic
talent.

## Psionic Training

The first step is testing a character's Psionic Strength, which is
determined as described above (2D6 – number of terms served). If the
character still has any Psionic Strength remaining, he can be trained.

Training requires four months of work, and costs ₢100,000. As part of
training, the character may attempt to learn any of the common psionic
talents on the Psionic Training table by making a Psionic Strength
check. He may attempt the talents in any order, but suffers a –1 DM per
check attempted. If a character learns a talent, he gains that talent at
level 0.

#### Table: Learning DMs by Talent

| Talent                                | Learning DM |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| Awareness                             | +1          |
| Clairvoyance                          | +3          |
| Telekinesis                           | +2          |
| Telepathy                             | +4          |
| Teleportation                         | +0          |
| Per previous talent acquisition check | –1          |

## Psionic Talents

There are several psionic talents, each of which works like a skill for
the powers in question. A character trained in the use of psionics may
develop his talents over time just as if they were normal skills. Unlike
other skills, psionic talents cannot be used untrained. The most common
talents are:

- **Awareness** – control over one's own mind and body.

- **Clairvoyance** – perceiving at a distance.

- **Telekinesis** – mind over matter.

- **Telepathy** – reading minds and mental communication.

- **Teleportation** – moving from one point to another instantly.

Each talent grants access to all of its powers – a character with
Telepathy 0 can use life detection, read surface thoughts or assault as
the situation demands.

### Using a Psionic Talent

To activate a talent, the psion must make a skill check using the
appropriate talent (Telepathy, Telekinesis, etc), adding his Psionic
Strength characteristic DM and any other DMs. He must also spend the
listed number of Psionic Strength points if he succeeds, or one point if
he fails. If this cost brings him below zero Psionic Strength, then any
excess points are applied to his Endurance score as damage. A character
with no Psionic Strength points cannot attempt to activate a power.

Using a talent in combat is a significant action.

Many abilities are ranged. The Psionic Range table lists the number of
points to project psionic abilities out to a given range – these must be
paid as well as any points to activate the ability. Each talent has a
different set of costs, with the exception of Awareness – all Awareness
abilities apply to the Psion only.

### Range 

Psionic range costs are paid based on range bands based on those used in
personal combat or communication devices. These are defined in the
Psionic Range Costs table.

#### Table: Psionic Range Costs

| Range        | Distance to Target       | Clairvoyance | Telekinesis | Telepathy | Teleportation |
|--------------|--------------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Personal     | Less than 1.5 meters     | 0            | 0           | 0         | 1             |
| Close        | 1.5 to 3 meters          | 0            | 2           | 1         | 1             |
| Short        | 3 to 12 meters           | 1            | 4           | 1         | 2             |
| Medium       | 12 to 50 meters          | 1            | 5           | 2         | 2             |
| Long         | 51 meters to 250 meters  | 2            | 7           | 2         | 3             |
| Very Long    | 251 meters to 500 meters | 2            | 9           | 3         | 3             |
| Distant      | 501 meters to 5 km       | 3            | --          | 3         | 4             |
| Very Distant | 5 km to 500 km           | 3            | --          | 4         | 4             |
| Regional     | 50 km to 500 km          | 4            | --          | 4         | 5             |
| Continental  | 500 km to 5000 km        | 4            | --          | 5         | 5             |

## Awareness

Awareness is the psionic talent which allows control of one's own body.
Awareness powers never have a range – they are used only on yourself.

#### Table: Awareness

| Ability                        | Difficulty          | Timing      | Cost    |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| Suspended Animation            | Average (+0)        | 1D6 minutes | 3       |
| Psionically Enhanced Strength  | Average (+0)        | 1D6 seconds | 1/Point |
| Psionically Enhanced Endurance | Average (+0)        | 1D6 seconds | 1/Point |
| Regeneration                   | Very Difficult (-4) | 1D6 rounds  | 1/Point |

### Suspended Animation

Personal body activity may be suspended for varying periods of time. A
character with Awareness may enter a suspended animation state (similar
to cold sleep but without the intrinsic danger of death) by willing
himself into it. Such a state continues for 7 days without need for food
or water and with minimal air needs. Such a person could effectively
travel in a low passage berth without actually undergoing cold sleep and
its dangers. Suspended animation may be stopped at any time previous to
its duration expiring, provided external stimulus is given to awaken the
sleeper (such as a friend or a mechanical alarm).

### Psionically Enhanced Strength

Psionic Strength points may be converted to normal Strength points on a
temporary basis. The character makes the commitment, reduces his Psionic
Strength by a specific number of points, and increases his physical
Strength characteristic by that number. In no case may the number of
Strength points gained exceed the character's current level in
Awareness, and Strength may not be increased beyond the character's
racial maximum. Psionically enhanced strength reaches its new level
immediately, remains at that peak for ten minutes, and then declines at
the rate of 1 Strength point per minute until the normal Strength level
is reached. This power works as normal on wounded characters but their
Strength returns to the wounded level rather than the normal value. It
cannot be used as a ‘quick heal'.

### Psionically Enhanced Endurance

Psionically enhanced endurance works in exactly the same way as
psionically enhanced strength except the characteristic boosted is
Endurance rather than Strength, including its lack of healing ability.

### Regeneration

Wounds and injuries may be healed rapidly. Strength, Dexterity and
Endurance lost to injury, disease, poison or other trauma may be healed
by the application of this ability, exchanging one Psionic Strength
point to regenerate one characteristic point. Any amount of Psionic
Strength may be expended with a single use of regeneration but it may
not be used again until all expended Psionic Strength is recovered.
Regeneration may also be applied to the growing of new limbs or organs
to replace lost ones or to heal unrecovered old wounds suffered prior to
psionic training. Regeneration may not be used to counteract aging.
Awareness is not capable of affecting others and may not be used for
healing or enhancing other characters.

## Clairvoyance

Clairvoyance is the general talent which allows a person to sense events
at some location displaced from the viewer. There are several levels of
clairvoyant ability. Clairvoyance abilities allow eavesdropping
activities as well as spying and detection-free exploration of
situations. While telepathic life detection will determine the presence
of living minds in a closed room, for example, sense will determine if a
room is occupied or empty. Clairvoyant activity cannot be sensed by
others, including by other psionic individuals.

#### Table: Clairvoyance

| Ability        | Difficulty     | Timing     | Cost    |
|----------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| Sense          | Routine (+2)   | 1D6 rounds | 1+Range |
| Clairvoyance   | Average (+0)   | 1D6 rounds | 2+Range |
| Clairaudience  | Average (+0)   | 1D6 rounds | 2+Range |
| Clairsentience | Difficult (-2) | 1D6 rounds | 3+Range |

### Sense

This is the basic ability to sense things at some point in the distance.
A character will become aware of the most rudimentary characteristics of
a location when applying this ability. For example, the Referee will
give a basic description, without detail: ‘a room containing four dogs'
or ‘an open plain with a tree, and no animals or men present'. The
clairvoyant character must state the range at which he is applying his
talent, and will generally sense the most interesting or important
feature at that range. The Effect of the check determines the level of
accuracy and clarity.

### Clairvoyance

This specific ability allows actual remote viewing of a situation at
some displaced point. Rather than the ‘snapshot' that sense gives,
clairvoyance allows the psion to observe as if he was there in person.
The clairvoyant character must state the range at which he is applying
his talent. The Effect of the check determines the level of detail
perceived and the duration in rounds the vision

can be maintained for.

### Clairaudience

This ability is identical to clairvoyance, with the exception that it
allows hearing instead of seeing.

### Clairsentience

This power combines the effects of clairvoyance and clairaudience. The
character is capable of both seeing and hearing a specific situation.

## Telekinesis

Telekinesis is the talent which allows objects to be manipulated without
physically touching them. Any manipulation is treated as if the person
was physically handling the item but physical danger, pain, or other
stimuli are not present. Telekinesis includes a limited amount of
sensory awareness, sufficient to allow actual intelligent manipulation.
The Effect of the check determines the duration of the telekinesis in
rounds.

Items may be thrown using telekinesis. Such items use the Ranged
(thrown) category when attacking, using the higher of the distance
between either the psion and the target or the object’s starting
location and the target. The amount of damage inflicted by such an
object is given in the Telekinesis object; the psion can add the Effect
of the attack’s skill check to the damage inflicted. If a creature is
the thrown object, both the creature and the target take the same damage
on a successful hit.

#### Table: Telekinesis

| Ability                        | Difficulty          | Timing      | Cost     | Throwing Damage |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|----------|-----------------|

| Telekinetically Lift 1000 kg   | Formidable (-6)     | 1D6 seconds | 10+Range | 8D6             |

## Telepathy

Telepathy is the talent of mind-to-mind contact. It is subtle by nature
but can also be used to bluntly crush the wills of those who oppose the
telepath.

#### Table: Telepathy

| Ability               | Difficulty          | Timing      | Cost    |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| Life Detection        | Easy (+4)           | 1D6 rounds  | 1+Range |
| Telempathy            | Routine (+2)        | 1D6 rounds  | 1+Range |
| Read Surface Thoughts | Average (+0)        | 1D6 rounds  | 2+Range |
| Send Thoughts         | Difficult (-2)      | 1D6 rounds  | 2+Range |
| Probe                 | Very Difficult (-4) | 1D6 minutes | 4+Range |
| Assault               | Formidable (-6)     | 1D6 seconds | 8+Range |
| Shield                | --                  | --          | --      |

### Life Detection

The most elementary form of telepathy is the ability to detect the
presence of other minds. Life detection enables a character to sense the
presence of other minds, the number of minds present, the general type
of minds (animal, human, and so on) and their approximate location.

Life detection is reasonably sophisticated, and can distinguish
intelligent beings from bacteria or unimportant animals in the area. It
functions best at detecting intelligent minds. Shielded minds are
undetectable (whether the shield is natural or artificial in origin). If
an individual whom the telepath knows is ‘life detected' he or she will
be recognized.

### Telempathy

The communication of emotions and basic feelings is accomplished by
telempathy. This ability serves well in the handling of animals and
beasts of burden but may also be applied as a psychological weapon
against humans. Sending of emotions such as love, hate, fear, and others
may influence other beings (although not necessarily in the manner
desired). Telempathy also allows the emotions and feelings of others to
be read by a character. The Effect of the check determines the strength
of the projected emotion.

Telepaths will always recognize when someone is using telempathy to bend
their emotions but others will not. The change in mood may be dramatic
and inexplicable but most people will simply ascribe it to the mercurial
nature of human emotions. Shielded individuals are immune to telempathy
as they are all other Telepathy powers.

### Read Surface Thoughts

The most widely known feature of Telepathy is the ability to read the
thoughts of other individuals. Only active, current thoughts are read by
this ability, with the subject (if himself not a telepath) unaware of
the activity. Individuals with telepathic ability cannot be read due to
the presence of their natural shields, unless they willingly lower their
shielding. The Effect of the check determines the clarity of the
telepath's perceptions.

### Send Thoughts

Complementary to the ability to read surface thoughts is the ability to
send thoughts to others. Such individuals need not themselves be
telepathic to receive such thoughts. Telepathic individuals are normally
open to such transmissions, but may close their shields against them if
they become bothersome or threatening.

### Probe

The application of great psionic strength will enable a telepath to
delve deep into the mind of a subject and to then read his innermost
thoughts. Questioning can be used in the procedure to force the subject
to divulge specific information. The prober can easily determine
deliberate untruths told (thought) by the subject. Probe cannot be used
against a shielded mind. Again, the Effect of the check determines the
clarity of the telepath's perceptions.

### Assault

Violence may be dealt by a telepath. An unshielded mind, when assaulted
telepathically, is rendered unconscious immediately and the character
suffers 2D6 + Effect damage. Unlike normal damage, assault damage is
applied to Psionic Strength (if the victim has it), then Intelligence,
then Endurance. Psionic Strength and Endurance return as normal.
Intelligence returns at the rate of one point per day.

When a shielded mind is assaulted the two telepaths make opposed
Telepathy checks. If the attacker wins, the victim suffers damage as
normal.

###  

### Shield

All telepathically able characters learn how to create a mental shield
which protects the mind against unwanted telepathic interference. Shield
is automatically in force at all times and requires no Psionic Strength
point expenditure to maintain. However, while a telepath has his shield
up he cannot use any telepathic powers either. Shield can be lowered to
allow telepathic contact or to use telepathic powers – this takes a mere
thought (a free action in combat).

## Teleportation

Teleportation is a talent which allows effectively instantaneous
movement from one point to another point without regard to intervening
matter. Psionic teleportation is limited to the movement of the
teleported character's body and (for highly skilled teleporters) his or
her clothing and other possessions.

#### Table: Teleportation

| Ability                      | Difficulty          | Timing      | Cost    |
|------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| Teleport self, unclothed     | Average (+0)        | 1D6 seconds | 0+Range |
| Teleport self, light load    | Difficult (-2)      | 1D6 seconds | 2+Range |
| Teleport self, moderate load | Very Difficult (-4) | 1D6 seconds | 3+Range |
| Teleport self, heavy load    | Very Difficult (-4) | 1D6 seconds | 4+Range |

Teleportation always involves the movement of one's body to another
location. Independent items or other individuals may not be moved.
Teleportation involves certain requirements in order to be accurate, and
to insure obedience of the laws of physics.

**Pre-Knowledge of Destination**: A character must always have a mental
image of his or her destination before teleporting. This mental image is
acquired by personally visiting the location first (or viewing it from a
distance), having the mental image implanted in one's mind (by
telepathy) by another person who has visited the destination, or by
viewing the location through clairvoyance. The key to remember is that
someone has to actually view the location – recorded images are not
enough.

**Energy and Momentum**: Teleportation involves serious restrictions on
movement in order to assure the conservation of energy and momentum.

On planetary surfaces, teleportation is restricted to jumps of Very
Distant range or less. Jumps at Very Distant range involve
disorientation for a period of 20 to 120 seconds (2D6x10) after arrival.
This restriction results from the law of conservation of momentum: on a
rotating planet, two locations will have different rotational speeds and
directions. A jump from a point on the Earth's equator to one of its
poles would result in a total velocity difference between the character
and his surroundings of over 3300 kph, which would lead to a messy death
in short order.

Teleporting to or from vehicles travelling at high speed can also result
in energy gains or losses. When teleporting into, onto or out of a
fast-moving vehicle the psion takes damage as if the vehicle had rammed
him at its current speed.

Changes in altitude (actually all movement to locations of differing
gravitational potential) will result in potential energy changes,
manifesting themselves as changes in body temperature. A jump of one
kilometer straight down will result in a temperature increase of 2.5
degrees Celsius; this is sufficient to cause extreme fever, brain
damage, and even death. A jump up will cool the body by the same amount,
with equally serious results. To be safe, a jump may not involve an
elevation change of more than 400 meters, and multiple jumps should not
involve a cumulative elevation change or more than 600 meters in one
hour. These problems may be gotten around through the use of
technological devices: energy compensators, heated suits, and other
means. Characters may feel driven to invent such materials, commission
their invention, or seek them out from those who already have them.

## Psionic Technology

In a Märchen Engine universe where psionic abilities are possible, the
following psionic-related technology may be available, either legally or
on the black market.

**Inhibitor Drug** (TL 9): Psionic inhibitors dampen the brain's ability
to generate psychic effects. A character who takes (or, more often, is
forcibly injected with) an inhibitor drug suffers a –4 DM to all Psionic
Strength checks and cannot regain Psionic Strength points. Each hour the
character may make an Endurance check to throw off the effects of the
drug with a +1 DM for every previous check. Inhibitor drugs have no
effect on non-psionic individuals. The drugs cost ₢500 per dose.

**Psi-Drugs** (TL 8+): These drugs restore Psionic Strength if taken
when the character has already spent Psionic Strength points, or
temporarily increase the character's Psionic Strength if taken when he
is at full Psionic Strength, as given in the Psi-Drug Effects and Cost
table.

#### Table: Psi-Drug Effects and Cost

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 17%" />

</table>

A character who takes more than one dose of Standard or Double Psi-Drug,
or a single dose of the Special drug must make an Endurance check, with
a –1 DM per dose of psi-drug taken in the last week (not including the
one just taken). If the check is failed the character falls ill with a
serious fever, suffering 3D6 damage and permanently reducing his Psionic
Strength by one.

**Psionic Shield** (TL 12): Any armor incorporating a helmet or hood can
be outfitted with a psionic shield, blocking Telepathy. Unlike the
Telepathy power shield a technological shield is invulnerable to assault
and blocks send thoughts. It cannot be lowered without removing the
helmet or hood containing the shield. ₢40,000.

Buildings and vehicles can also be psionically shielded, but this is
much more costly, increasing the cost by 10%.

**Teleportation Suit** (TL 12): This device can be integrated into a
suit of armor or worn as a form-hugging body-suit. It rapidly cools or
warms the body after a teleport, minimizing the damage from sudden
energy gains or losses. The suit costs ₢50,000 and allows a character to
jump up to 600 meters up or down in a single teleport, or up to ten
kilometers in a single hour when using successive jumps.

**Psionic Interface** (TL 14): Any weapon or technological device can be
outfitted with a psionic interface. A character using a device with a
psionic interface can use his Psionic Strength DM instead of his
Dexterity DM when using the weapon or device; a character without
psionic ability cannot use the device. The character must either touch
the device or use telekinesis to interact with it at range. Adding a
psionic interface increases the cost of the device by 20%.

## Psionics in Society

The Märchen Engine assumes that there are generally three different
mindsets in which a society might view psionics. In generic terms, these
categories are called Psi-Hostile, Psi-Neutral and Psi-Friendly.

### Psi-Hostile Societies

Humanity fears what it doesn't understand. In Psi-Hostile societies,
some precipitating event has brought that fear into the court of public
opinion, and as a result, psionics became banned. In the least offensive
case, the use of psionics is forbidden and violations are punished as a
capital crime. In the worst cases, governments and angry mobs often go
on witch hunts, looking for psions and generally lynching, lobotomizing,
imprisoning or exiling the offenders. Individuals may even be informants
or potential informants, ready to call the local authorities at the
slightest hint of psionic abilities in use. Governments in psi-hostile
societies will publicly denounce the use of psionics, but it is likely
that they might maintain a secret training facility due to the
usefulness of such powers in espionage and warfare. In a Psi-Hostile
society, even having sympathy for the plight of psionic people can cause
an individual to be ostracized.

This type of society is the most commonly encountered in Märchen Engine
campaigns, because the world it creates is closest to the “real world”
experiences shared by most Märchen Engine players, and the rules tend to
operate as if this were the standard.

### Psi-Neutral Societies

In Psi-Neutral societies, psionics does not have the stigma that they do
in Psi-Hostile societies. The general populace recognizes the existence
of psions, and considers it just another set of talents one can possess,
much like athletic prowess or superior marksmanship. The use of psionics
is fairly regulated by law level, as the public is aware that psionics
have great potential for abuse, but such a culture generally holds a
stronger view of personal responsibility and punishes abusers
accordingly. Training in such a culture is easier to come by, but is
treated much like a vocational school, in that only those who can pay
for it are tested and trained. Psionic technology is more likely to be
available in such a society, at the discretion of the Referee. Telepaths
figure prominently in major corporate and government negotiations.
Teleporters are used for quick and sometimes clandestine courier work.
Corporate and foreign espionage require another layer of security to
address psionic abilities. The accepted use of psionics in such a
culture can cause some dramatic changes.

### Psi-Friendly Societies

In Psi-Friendly societies, psions are revered and psionic abilities are
often considered a mark of the socially elite. It is likely that
children are tested at various points during their childhood, and those
with potential are taught to use their gifts from a very young age.
Psionics are integrated at every level of society, and may even lead to
a highly structured or caste-like culture where the upper classes are
comprised of psionically-gifted individuals. These classes may be
further stratified based on an individual’s psionic strength and/or
mastery of psionic skills. Non-psions may even be persecuted as
second-class citizens without voting or personal rights, in extreme
cases. The actual culture of such a society, like anything else, is
ultimately up to the Referee to determine and present.

# CHAPTER 5: SORCERY

We have discussed the "sword" part of "sword & sorcery" – namely,
equipment and combat. Now it is time to discuss the second part of this
genre: sorcery and magic!

Firstly, these rules follow sword & sorcery genre conventions.
Spellcasting is slow and dangerous; magic is powerful and terrible;
spells are less often "flashy" than in traditional dungeon fantasies.
Using magic to harm or enslave others may in fact corrupt the sorcerer.
These are not rules for fireball-throwing wizards who can fly on a whim.
Rather, they present sorcerers dealing with dangerous Dark Arts and
wielding far less flamboyant, but much more insidious power.

### Initial Known Spells

Characters begin play with two known spells per level of Sorcery skill,
plus any spells gained as mustering out benefits. They may learn
additional spells in the course of their adventures.

### Reading and sensing magic

All sorcerers can attempt to read magical writings and sense magical
power in their vicinity. This does not require actual spellcasting, but
rather a simple Sorcery skill throw.

Under most circumstances, throw Sorcery 8+ to read an eldritch text. The
Referee may modify this throw based on the text's complexity. This throw
does not allow deciphering texts written in mundane languages the
sorcerer does not know, but only magical writings, such as scrolls,
runes, and sigils. Reading most short texts, such as a scroll, takes one
turn (10 minutes). Longer texts, such as spell books, may require much
more time. The sorcerer may retry this throw, but this will take another
time period (a turn or more) to read the material. If the throw is Snake
Eyes (a "natural" 2), however, the sorcerer cannot read this specific
magical text for a year and a day.

A character with at least Sorcery-0 is aware of the flow of eldritch
energy around them. If they suspect that magic is at work in their
vicinity, they may throw Sorcery 8+ to attempt to detect the magic. On a
successful throw, the character will sense any sources of magical energy
within a 10m radius. Each such attempt takes one turn (10 minutes). Note
that in this case, the Referee makes the throw in secret.

## The Basics of Sorcery

Any character, regardless of skill, may attempt to cast a spell they
know. Of course, characters without the Sorcery skill suffer from the
usual Unskilled DM-3, and thus take great risks in casting even the
simplest of spells.

There is no "hard" limit to the number of spells a character may cast in
a day. In Märchen Engine, there are neither spell slots nor any need to
memorize magic. There is no need for spell books, though many sorcerers
write such sorcerous texts (Codices) to help teach disciples. However,
there are two main limiting factors to a sorcerer's spellcasting
ambition: casting time and the risk of mishaps, both discussed below.

Spells come in six **Circles** of varying power, from the weakest
1<sup>st</sup> Circle to the utterly powerful 6<sup>th</sup> Circle. The
Circle determines the spellcasting difficulty.

Casting a regular spell takes one turn (10 minutes). Some spells. The
only way to cast a spell within a single combat round (6 seconds) is to
charge a Focus beforehand, as detailed below.

Casting a spell is a Sorcery throw. The following table lists the target
numbers for such throws.

A throw of "Snake Eyes" (a result of double-ones on 2d6) is a Critical
Failure – it will fail regardless of skill. A throw with an Effect of -4
or worse is also a Critical Failure. A throw of "boxcars" (a result of
double sixes on 2d6) is always a success, regardless of skill or spell
difficulty.

On a success, the spell is cast at the end of the turn, as long as the
sorcerer retains concentration (see below).

**Spellcasting**

| **Circle** | **Difficulty Throw** |
|------------|----------------------|
| 1          | 7+                   |
| 2          | 8+                   |
| 3          | 9+                   |
| 4          | 10+                  |
| 5          | 11+                  |
| 6          | 12+                  |

## Concentration

A sorcerer must maintain concentration while casting a spell. When
casting an ordinary spell, the sorcerer may take a break of one round
(at most) from the ceremony to speak, move up to 3m, drink a liquid, and
so on. If the sorcerer loses concentration for a longer period while
casting a spell, or if they take any damage while casting a spell, the
spell is broken, and the sorcerer suffers a Critical Failure – and might
also suffer a mishap.

## Learning Spells

Any character may attempt to learn a spell from a scroll or spell codex.
Studying a spell takes a week and requires a Sorcery throw equal to that
required to cast the spell. The character may re-attempt this throw,
which takes one week for attempt. A result of 2 before modifiers will
destroy the specific spell formula (but not the entire codex); throwing
an unmodified 12 is always successful regardless of difficulty.

Unskilled characters may attempt to learn spells as above, albeit with
DM-3 for being Unskilled.

### Unknown Spells

A character may attempt to cast a spell directly from a Codex without
studying it, albeit at DM-2. In that case, *any* failure is critical and
entails a throw, again with DM-2, to avoid a Mishap. This penalty is
cumulative with a the Unskilled penalty – woe to the fool who carelessly
meddles with a sorcerous text!

## Critical Failures

A spell critically fails in one of the following cases:

- The sorcerer throws a natural 2 on the spellcasting throw.

- The sorcerer's Effect in the spellcasting throw is -4 or worse.

- The sorcerer's concentration is broken while casting a spell.

In such a case, the spell fails automatically, and the sorcerer has
wasted the spellcasting time, either a turn, or longer for rituals.

Additionally, the sorcerer must make another Sorcery throw, with the
same throw difficulty and DMs of casting the spell, to avoid a mishap.

On a mishap, throw on the Spellcasting Mishap table.

**Spellcasting Mishaps**

| **D66** | **Spellcasting Mishap**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Talismans and Foci

Sorcerers use magical tools to assist them in spellcasting: Talismans
and Foci. A Talisman adds a +DM to spellcasting throws, while a Focus
allows casting a specific spell in one round (6 seconds) rather than in
one turn (10 minutes).

### Talismans

Talismans are objects such as staves, shamanic masks, or rings that
empower a sorcerer's magic. A talisman is considered one object for
encumbrance purposes. Lesser talismans grant DM+1 to spellcasting
throws, while greater talismans grant DM+2 to such throws. Characters
may only enjoy the benefit of one talisman at a time.

A sorcerer may create a talisman using the Artifice skill, just as any
other magical item. See the Magic Items chapter for further details. A
sorcerer may, of course, pay an artificer to make a talisman for them,
or rob another sorcerer of their talisman.

To use a talisman, a sorcerer must be *attuned* to it. This requires 1D
weeks of intermittent contact with the talisman. The sorcerer may
adventure during that time but must keep the talisman at hand.

### Foci

Foci allow a sorcerer to prepare a spell ahead of time, then cast it
within one round. There are disposable and rechargeable foci. Unlike
talismans, foci are personal. A sorcerer may only use their own focus. A
focus recovered from another sorcerer will not work but may be
"recycled" into one of the sorcerer's own foci of the same Circle,
reducing its price by half. Making foci requires at least Sorcery-1 but
no skill throw. It simply costs a sum of gold in various components,
often found in curio shops and the darker corners of markets.

A focus is specific for a given spell. For example, if the sorcerer
makes a rechargeable focus for **call wolf**, he may not use it to store
**respite**.

Three foci constitute one "item" for encumbrance purposes.

**Foci Costs**

| **Circle** | **Disposable** | **Rechargeable** |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1          | 5₢             | 500₢             |
| 2          | 10₢            | 1000₢            |
| 3          | 15₢            | 1500₢            |
| 4          | 25₢            | 2250₢            |
| 5          | 35₢            | 3000₢            |
| 6          | 50₢            | 4000₢            |

Creating a focus takes one day for a disposable focus or one week for a
rechargeable focus. Afterwards, the sorcerer must cast the spell into a
focus to charge it. This requires a regular Sorcery throw, taking the
regular time and carrying the normal risk of mishap, but at DM-1 due to
the complexity of storing the spell in a focus.

Using a prepared, charged focus requires one action and does not require
any additional Sorcery throws.

## The Shades of Magic

Magic is powerful but dangerous. Beyond the risk of failure and mishap
detailed above, certain spells are unhealthy for the caster's soul.
Using magic to harm or enslave others is inherently corrupting. Spells
come in three categories, or shades. Spells which are wholesome in
purpose are considered **white magic**. Spells which may or may not
corrupt the sorcerer, depending on the circumstances, are **grey
magic**. Spells which always corrupt are **black magic**.

Spells that heal, protect, provide information, or call existing
creatures to the sorcerer's aid are white magic. Damaging spells or
spells that charm or command sentient beings for a limited time are grey
magic. Necromancy, summoning monsters out of thin air, and magically
enslaving sentient creatures for the long term are black magic.

### Corruption

Sorcerers gain **corruption points** – representing the blackening and
corruption of their soul – in various ways:

- Each time a sorcerer learns a black magic spell, they gain a number of
  corruption points equal to the spell's Circle.

- Each time a sorcerer casts a black magic spell, they gain 1 corruption
  point.

- Each time a sorcerer uses a grey magic spell to coerce, deceive, or
  harm a Lawful or Neutral sentient being, they gain 1 corruption point.
  Casting grey magic spells against Chaotic beings (i.e. undead, evil
  monsters, cultists, and so on) or Neutral animals does not cause
  corruption.

When a sorcerer accumulates a number of corruption points equal to three
times, their END characteristic, and for each additional multiple of
their END characteristic, the sorcerer acquires a corrupting weakness,
by rolling once on the following table. For example, a sorcerer with END
9 would roll on the Corruption Weakness table after gaining 27
corruption points, and then at 36, 45, and 54 points, and so on.

**Corruption Weakness**

| **D66** | **Corruption Weakness**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Treat all situations with full darkness as being dim light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 23      | You are afflicted with a non-contagious wasting disease, virulence 8+, damage 2D, interval 1D days. A **cure disease** spell or a successful throw will stop the deterioration, but the damage already done cannot be healed by any means.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 26      | Your skin gains a chameleon-like color-changing characteristic. Gain DM+1 to Recon and Stealth checks. However, your face gains some chameleon-like characteristics as well, causing DM-2 to all social skill throws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

You permanently lose 1D points each from your STR, DEX, and END (to a minimum of 1) and your movement rate is halved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 32      | You grow unnaturally obese. Double your weight; you need armor custom-made for your shape at double cost; and you must consume double the amount of food a character usually does (but not double water).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 33      | You grow an alien eye in the middle of your forehead. This eye is closed most of the time. Three times a day, you can open this eye to use the **mind probe** spell without a throw. However, you are such a frightful sight that you suffer DM-4 to all social skills and Reaction throws.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 34      | You gain a stench which is attractive to predatory animals. The Referee may increase the chance of random encounters with such predators (which may even include predatory monsters) as they see fit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 35      | The fabric of your mind cracks. Each day upon awakening, throw INT 6+ or completely forget who you are for that day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 36      | You devolve into an ape-like (or primitive lizard-like) shape – your skin grows hairy (or scaly), your legs grow short, and your arms grow long. You move on half speed if you stand on both legs, but in regular speed if you move on all fours. You may not use your hands for wielding weapons or carrying items when you move in such a way. Armor for your misshapen body costs twice as much.                                                                                                    |
| 41      | Your joints double and become flexible. You may slip any bonds or manacles with a DEX 6+ throw (taking 1 round). However, your hands are less stable, and you suffer DM-1 to all attack throws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 42      | Your mouth grows large and your teeth sharpen. You can bite for 1D damage but cannot speak humanoid languages. You may still cast spells, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 43      | You gain an animal-like stench. This causes DM-2 to Reaction throws for sentient beings but DM+2 to reaction throws for animals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 44      | You grow a pair of bat-like (or pterodactyl-like) wings. You may fly for short durations (1D rounds per jaunt, requiring a turn of rest afterwards) at a 20m per round speed in any direction. Armor adapted to your shape costs x10 the normal cost and you suffer DM-1 to social-skill and Reaction throws.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 45      | Your thoughts devolve into madness under the stress of combat. In every battle throw 1D; on 1 you may not act; on 2-5, you must attack the nearest enemy; on 6, you must attack your nearest ally. The madness dissipates when combat ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 46      | Your ears grow huge, with bat-like appearance. You may sense obstacles and creatures up to 10m, even in pitch darkness by echolocation, but cannot wear any helmet and suffer DM-1 to social-skill and Reaction throws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 51      | You become a delicate and unnaturally beautiful creature. Gain DM+1 to all reaction and social-skill throws; lose 3 points each of STR and END (to a minimum of 1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 52      | You grow sharp horns. You may head-butt for 1D + STR DM damage but may not wear any helmet and suffer DM-1 to social-skill and Reaction throws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 53      | You instantly age by 1D character generation four-year terms. If appropriate, throw on the Aging table (see the Character generation chapter).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 54      | You grow a prehensile tail. You may grab objects with your tail, but armor adapted to your new form costs double and you suffer DM-1 to social-skill and Reaction throws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 55      | One of your arms becomes a monstrous tentacle. You may attack for 1D+your STR DM with the tentacle but suffer DM-2 to all throws requiring fine manipulation, and your SOC is reduced by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 56      | You transmit your emotions telepathically to everyone within 10m. You may never successfully lie but gain DM+1 to social-skill throws in "positive" situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 61      | You gain characteristics of a random animal; as a result, 3 characteristics will increase by 2 points each, and 3 will be reduced by 2 points each, to a minimum of 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 62      | You become a nocturnal creature. You gain low-light vision but suffer DM-2 to attack throws in daylight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 63      | You become sterile and may not have offspring by natural means.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 64      | You gain an insectile appearance, including "bug eyes" and your teeth are replaced with insect mandibles. You suffer DM-3 to all social-skill and Reaction throws but gain DM+2 to throws to resist poison and disease. Reroll if you are already an insectoid being (if you are using the optional Appendix A).                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 65      | Your body begins to rot. Maggots constantly crawl out of your orifices, and flies buzz around you ceaselessly. Your SOC becomes 1, and your movement rate is halved. You may no longer heal naturally – only magic can heal your wounds, but not reverse this condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 66      | Your biological system resets itself; lose one mutation (reroll if you have no mutations).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Note that no magic, even **Restoration**, can reverse mutations. Only a
throw of "66" on the Mutation table may reverse mutations.

### Optional Rule: Prestidigitation

For slightly more "magical" sorcery, the Referee may allow a character
with at least Sorcery-0 to perform minor magical tricks without risking
mishaps or corruption. This includes things such as short-range
ventriloquism, lighting a small flame with one's fingers, or changing a
small fire's color. Throw Sorcery 4+ to perform such tricks; a "natural"
throw of 2 means failure regardless of skill but does not entail risk of
a mishap. Such tricks take one combat round (6 seconds) to perform.

The Referee must be very careful with this kind of "cantrips", lest they
become an easy way to circumvent the rigors of sorcery and ruin the
darker feel of the sword & sorcery world. Perhaps limiting the use of
such “parlor tricks” to once per day.

### Optional Rule: Hasty Casting

For a higher magic setting, the Referee may allow sorcerers to cast
spells within 1 round, subject to DM-2 for rushing. Thus, skilled
sorcerers will be able to cast combat spells without requiring foci,
albeit at an increased risk. The Referee should consider this rule
carefully, as it will make magic significantly more powerful for skilled
spellcasters, especially ones with Greater Talismans.

## Spells

This sub-chapter details 108 spells of all three shades and all six
Circles.

Note that the term "sorcerer" in the spells below refers to any
spellcaster, regardless of career or title.

While the list of spells below is quite extensive, sorcerers often work
on creating variations of existing spells, or even completely new
spells. While the details are left to the Referee, the effects of the
spells below can be used as a guide to what Circle, Color, effects and
consequences of a new spell would cause. As a general rule, a sorcerer
should spend a minimum of one year per Circle at a cost of 10000₢ per
Circle to create a new spell. Variations of existing spells reduce the
time and gold required to months instead of years, and 1000₢, per
circle.

### Spells

**Animate Dead**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 10m radius around the Sorcerer

Duration: 1 day

The spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead
skeletons or zombies that follow the sorcerer's spoken commands. The
caster may animate a number of skeletons equal to four times his Sorcery
skill, or half that number in zombies. An animated skeleton requires a
relatively intact skeleton; an animated zombie requires a relatively
intact corpse. The undead crumble to dust once the spell expires.

**Anti-Magic Shell**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 3m radius

Duration: 12 turns

This spell creates a barrier around the sorcerer, stopping any spell or
spell-like effect (including the sorcerer's own magic) from passing
through it until the duration ends or the spellcaster dismisses the
spell. Spells with a range of "self" or "touch" cast by the sorcerer are
not blocked. The **anti-magic shell** itself may not be **dispelled** by
a **dispel** spell or similar effect.

**Augury**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Self

Duration: Special

This spell can tell the sorcerer whether a particular action will bring
good or bad results in the immediate future. The sorcerer can only see
up to 3 turns (30 minutes) into the future. Anything which would happen
after that, such as long-term consequences of a contemplated action,
will not affect the result of **Augury**.

**Bane**

2nd Circle (Black)

Range: Self

Duration: 6 turns

This spell fills the sorcerer's enemies (within a 15m radius around the
sorcerer) with doubt and dread, causing them DM-1 to attack, damage, and
morale throws, as well as throws to resist fear.

**Bestow Curse**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 10m

Duration: Instantaneous

The sorcerer places a curse on a target creature or object. A creature
may throw INT 9+ to resist the curse. The caster must choose one of the
following effects as the curse:

- Halve one characteristic score (round up)

- DM-3 to all attack throws.

- Panic: each round of combat, the target must throw 1D; on 1-3, it acts
  normally, on 4-6, it takes no action.

The caster may invent a different curse, but should not be more powerful
than the examples above; this is at the Referee's discretion.

The curse is permanent, unless removed by the **remove curse** spell.

**Bless**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Self

Duration: 6 turns

This spell grants the sorcerer and their allies (within a 15m radius
around the sorcerer) DM+1 to attack, damage, and morale throws, as well
as throws to resist fear.

**Blood Boil**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 50m

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell boils the blood of a single living creature, causing great
suffering and severe wounds – and potentially causing it to explode! The
target must throw END 10+; if failed, it will suffer 5D damage and be
stunned (lose its next combat round). If successful, the target is not
stunned, but still takes 3D damage.

In either case, if that damage reduces all three of the target's
physical characteristics to zero, the target detonates, killing it
immediately. Each creature or object within 2m of the target suffers 1D
damage.

**Call galloping herd**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Special

Duration: 1 day

The spell calls one or more **horses** or **giant lizards** (depending
on the setting) to serve as mounts for the characters. The spell may
call a herd of 10 light horses or 5 heavy horses, or a lounge of 5 giant
lizards (sorcerer's choice; depending on the setting). When called, the
animals travel to the sorcerer's location at their wilderness travel
rate. If cast within inhabited terrain, or wilderness of grass, hills,
or scrub, the animals will arrive within 1D turns. If cast in any other
type of terrain, they will arrive within 3D turns. If cast in a place
inaccessible to riding animals (such as deep underground), the mounts
will wait as close as possible.

For the duration of the spell, the mounts will understand the sorcerer's
speech and serve them as a loyal companion.

The spell persists until it is **dispelled**, or one day passes (at the
end of which the mounts depart). The sorcerer may increase the spell's
duration by casting it again a short time before that day ends.

Note that this spell only calls animals, and not saddle and tack; it
also does not grant anyone the Riding skill, though the animals are
quite used to being ridden.

**Call great cats**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Special

Duration: 1 day

This spell calls one or more **great cats** to the sorcerer to serve as
companions (see the Monsters chapter). This spell calls forth 6 mountain
lions, 6 panthers, 4 lions, or 4 tigers. If cast in terrain native to
such cats, the cats arrive within 1D turns. Otherwise, they arrive
within 3D turns. If cast in a place inaccessible to great cats (such as
deep underground or in a well-guarded city), the cats will wait as close
as possible.

For the duration of the spell, the cats will understand the sorcerer's
speech and serve as loyal friends and companions.

The spell persists until it is **dispelled**, or one day passes (at the
end of which the cats depart). The sorcerer may increase the spell's
duration by casting it again a sort time before that day ends

**Call Leviathan**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Special

Duration: 1 day

This spell works only in the open sea, calls a sperm whale or a
plesiosaur (depending on setting) to serve as the sorcerer's companion.
The whale will take 4D turns to arrive, unless the Referee decides that
a pod of whales is nearby. The whale will travel as close as possible to
the sorcerer (near a boat, along the shore, etc.) and serve as a friend
and companion; it will even allow the sorcerer to ride it, or attack
ships and monsters at their command.

The spell persists until the whale is slain, the spell is **dispelled**,
or one day passes (at that time, the whale departs). The sorcerer may
increase the spell's duration by casting it again a sort time before
that day ends

**Call Lightning**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 120m

Duration: 3 turns per Sorcery skill rank

This spell only works when a storm is within range. It enables the
sorcerer to call down a lightning bolt every turn (10 minutes) on any
point within range. The lightning bolt strikes from the sky, hitting an
area 6m in diameter. All creatures within the hit area suffer 6D damage,
or 3D if they successfully throw DEX 8+. The lightning bolts will remain
available until either the storm or the spells end.

**Call lightning** may damage vehicles – it has an AV value of 3D and
will set wooden ships on fire.

**Call Animal**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Special

Duration: 1 day

The spell calls a wild predatory **animal** (such as a wolf or
equivalent) to serve as the sorcerer's companion. When called, the
animal will travel to the sorcerer. If cast within the natural habitat
of such animals, such as a steppe, forest, or mountains, the wolf will
arrive within 1D turns. Otherwise, it will arrive within 3D turns. If
cast in a place inaccessible to wild predators (such as deep underground
or in a well-guarded city), the animal will wait as close as possible.

In some settings, a **deinonychus** will appear, and the spell will be
commonly known as **call raptor**.

For the duration of the spell, the animal will understand the sorcerer's
speech and serve them as a loyal companion.

The spell persists until it is **dispelled**, or one day passes (at the
end of which the animal departs). The sorcerer may increase the spell's
duration by casting it again a sort time before that day ends.

**Call Animal Pack**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Special

Duration: 1 day

This spell calls a pack of predatory **animals** (in some settings –
deinonychi) to serve as the sorcerer's companions. One animal will
respond to the call plus two additional wolves per Sorcery skill rank
the sorcerer possesses. Other than the number of animals, this spell is
identical to **call animal**.

**Capsizing Wave**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 45m

Duration: Instantaneous

The spell smashes a sea vessel with a mighty wave capable of sinking
even the mightiest sailing ships. The wave is approximately 50m long, 5m
high, and 3m thick. The captain of the target vessel may attempt to
steer their ship out of the wave's deadly path with a Watercraft 10+
throw. If the captain does not try to evade the wave, or if the
Watercraft throw fails, the vessel is stricken – throw once on the
Critical damage table (see the naval combat rules in the Combat
chapter).

**Cause Disease**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

The sorcerer infests the target with a horrid wasting disease, virulence
10+, damage 3D, interval 2D days. While ill, the subject suffers DM-2 to
all skill and attack throws and cannot heal or be healed. A **cure
disease** or **restoration** spell is the only way to cure this illness.

**Cause fear**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 36m

Duration: 2 turns per Sorcery skill rank

The sorcerer scares one creature within 40m; the creature must throw END
8+ or flee for the duration.

**Cause minor wounds**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

The sorcerer causes 2D damage to the target.

**Cause serious wounds**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

The sorcerer causes 5D damage to the target.

**Charm Animal**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 20m

Duration: special

This spell allows the sorcerer to charm an animal (including normal and
giant animals but not humanoids or fantastic creatures) in the same
fashion as **charm person** (see below). Unintelligent animals cannot
resist this spell and are charmed automatically; smarter animals, such
as whales or apes, may throw INT 8+ to resist the spell. Once in place,
the charm lasts until the animal successfully resists the spell or the
effect is **dispelled**. One throw is allowed every month.

**Charm Person**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 20m

Duration: special

This spell causes one humanoid creature to treat the sorcerer as a
trusted friend and ally. The target must throw INT 8+ or be charmed. If
it is currently under attack by the sorcerer of the sorcerer's allies,
the target enjoys DM+3 to this throw. The spell does not allow its
caster to directly control the targets, but rather, the subject
interprets the caster's words and actions in a favorable way. It will
not do anything it will not normally do, and unusual requests will grant
another INT 8+ throw to resist the effect. The caster must speak the
subject's language to give commands. Of course, if the caster is
attacked, the charmed creature will rush to defend its "friend". The
subject receives another INT 8+ to resist the effect once a day if it
has INT 9 or better, every week if it has INT 6-8, or every month if it
has INT 5 or less. A **dispel magic** removes the charm.

**Chimerical Force**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 100m

Duration: Concentration + 2 rounds

This spell creates a visual and auditory illusion of an object,
creature, or force imagined by the sorcerer, up to a maximum size of 10m
x 10m x 10m. The illusion does not create smell, texture, or
temperature. The sorcerer may move the illusion within the effect size
limit. The image persists as long as the sorcerer concentrates, plus 2
additional rounds after ceasing concentration.

If used to simulate creatures, they will disappear if successfully hit
in combat. If simulating an attack, the illusory damage will be
equivalent damage of such attack, though an INT 8+ throw by the target
will void this damage. The damage, in any case, is unreal; those
"killed" or "injured" by this spell will realize they are unharmed
within 1D rounds.

**Choking Grip**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 10m

Duration: special

The spell allows the sorcerer to telekinetically grip a target
creature's throat. The target must throw STR 8+ or begin choking,
suffering 1D damage. A choking creature cannot attack, cast spells,
move, or take any other action, but may speak in a choked voice.

When the sorcerer's next initiative step comes up, if they maintain
concentration on the spell, the target must throw STR 8+ again; on a
successful throw, the spell ends. On failure, the target continues
choking, and takes another 1D damage.

The spell lasts until **dispelled**, the sorcerer stops concentrating on
it, or the target makes a successful STR 8+ throw to end the spell.

**Cloud of Poison**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: special

Duration: 6 turns

The sorcerer draws forth a **cloud of poison** from the dark miasmas of
the atmosphere. As this spell draws its power from natural miasmas, it
may only be cast outdoors or in a well-ventilated room. The cloud is 10m
in diameter and spreads out from the sorcerer's fingertips. It moves at
20m per round away from the spellcaster. The poison gas is heavier than
air and will sink down holes or slide downhill. Trees or thick
vegetation break the cloud. The cloud has virulence 10+ and 1D damage.
Any character staying within the cloud must throw against its virulence
again each round it remains in the cloud, and thus slowly suffocate if
unlucky.

**Command Plants**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 20m

Duration: Concentration

The spell grants the sorcerer the ability to command plants and
plant-like creatures within a 3m by 3m area, up to 20m away. Intelligent
plant-like creatures may throw INT 8+ to avoid this effect; otherwise,
the spell works automatically. The controlled plants will obey the
spellcaster's commands and may move even if they are usually immobile.
The effect lasts as long as the sorcerer concentrates. Intelligent
plants will be very hostile to the sorcerer once the spell ends.

**Commune**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Self

Duration: 3 turns

The sorcerer reaches out to greater powers or spirits, who will answer
three yes-or-no questions. The being contacted may or may not be
omniscient but will provide truthful answers. The sorcerer may cast this
spell once a week at most.

**Conjure demon spawn**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 75m

Duration: special (1 day)

The sorcerer opens a portal to the Outer Dark and summons a **demon
spawn**. Generate the demon spawn with two special abilities per the
Random Demon rules in the Monsters chapter. A sorcerer may only
successfully summon one demon spawn per day. The demon serves the caster
for up to one day, as long as the sorcerer concentrates on controlling
it – suffering damage while concentrating on the spell breaks
concentration, as does casting another spell. The sorcerer may send the
demon back to hell at will. However, if the caster loses concentration
without first dismissing the demon, it will attack the caster and its
allies. Only a **dispel magic**, **dispel Evil**, or slaying the demon
will banish it one it is uncontrolled. An uncontrolled demon can return
to its home dimension at will, but some would love to stay in the mortal
world to wreak havoc and spread Chaos.

**Conjure dybbuk**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 75m

Duration: special (1 day)

The sorcerer opens a portal to the Outer Dark, calling forth a
**dybbuk** with three special abilities per the Random Demon rules in
the Monsters chapter. Otherwise, the spell is identical to Conjure demon
spawn.

**Conjure Elemental**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 75m

Duration: Special

The sorcerer opens a portal to one of the elemental planes – Air, Earth,
Fire, or water – and calls forth an **elemental** from that plane. At
most one elemental of each type may be conjured by the same sorcerer on
the same day. Once the elemental appears, it serves the sorcerer as long
as they concentrate on controlling the elemental. At any point while
controlling the elemental, the sorcerer may dismiss it back to its
plane. A **dispel magic** or **dispel evil** spell also sends it back to
its plane. However, if the spellcaster loses concentration, they lose
control of the elemental – and such control may not be regained. The
elemental rampages and attacks all in its path. Eventually – typically
within 1D turns – it returns to its native plane on its own volition,
but always after wreaking havoc on the Material Plane.

**Conjure fiend**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 75m

Duration: special (1 day)

The sorcerer opens a portal to the Outer Dark, calling forth a **fiend**
with four special abilities per the Random Demon rules in the Monsters
chapter. Otherwise, the spell is identical to Conjure demon spawn.

**Conjure hellion**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 75m

Duration: special (1 day)

The sorcerer opens a portal to the Outer Dark, calling forth a
**hellion** with two special abilities per the Random Demon rules in the
Monsters chapter. Otherwise, the spell is identical to Conjure demon
spawn.

**Conjure imp**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 75m

Duration: special (1 day)

The sorcerer opens a portal to the Outer Dark, calling forth an **imp**
with two special abilities per the Random Demon rules in the Monsters
chapter. Otherwise, the spell is identical to Conjure demon spawn.

**Contact Other Dimensions**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: Self

Duration: Special

The sorcerer sends their mind to another dimension to converse with the
powers residing on that plane. The power – an alien god – replies in a
language the sorcerer comprehends but it resents contact with petty
mortals, and will only answer questions by "yes", "no", "maybe",
"never", or "irrelevant". The sorcerer may ask three questions per
Sorcery skill rank.

For each question asked, the Referee should secretly throw against the
Sorcerer’s INT 6+. On a success, the alien god provides a truthful
answer. On a failure, it will provide no information, or false
information (Referee's choice).

Upon the spell's completion, the sorcerer must throw INT 8+ or go insane
for 1D weeks from the shock and horror of conversing with an alien god.

**Control Weather**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: Self

The spell allows the sorcerer to create a special weather condition in
their vicinity. The spell only works outdoors, and the radius is limited
to a 100m radius. The spell works indefinitely as long as the sorcerer
is stationary and concentrates on it. See the following table for
potential weather conditions.

| **Weather**  | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Calm         | Dissipates foul weather. Sailing ships may not move.                                                                                                              |
| Hot          | Dries wet conditions. Movement halved.                                                                                                                            |
| Cold         | Water and mud freeze. Movement halved.                                                                                                                            |
| Severe winds | All movement divided by 2, no flying or ranged weapon use possible. On sandy terrain, this reduced visibility to 6m. Sailing ships move at double speed.          |
| Tornado      | The sorcerer directs the whirlwind, moving at 40m per round. The tornado may attack as an air elemental. Sea vessels struck by a tornado suffer 1D damage "hits". |
| Foggy        | Visibility dropped to 6m. Movement halved.                                                                                                                        |
| Rainy        | Ranged attacks suffer DM-1 to hit. Mud forms within 3 turns, which halves movement rates.                                                                         |
| Blizzard     | Visibility drops to 6m. Movement halved. Characters take damage as per Arctic conditions.                                                                         |

**Control Winds**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 10m radius per Sorcery skill rank

Duration: 3 turns per Sorcery skill rank

The spell subjects the air within the affected volume to the sorcerer's
will. They can calm the air or grow the wind up to gale force. To change
the wind completely (such as from gale to calm), the sorcerer must
concentrate for one turn.

When used at sea, this spell may increase or decrease a ship's speed, as
per the sea travel rules in the Adventuring chapter.

Gale force winds affect characters and combatants. In a gale, missile
weapon use is impossible; flying creatures crash to the ground, and
creatures on the ground move at half their speed. In sandy or dusty
terrain, clouds of dust will reduce visibility to a range of 6m.

**Convalescence**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

The subject heals as if they have rested for 5D days.

**Cure Disease**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell cures all diseases the subject is suffering from, including
magical ones, as well as parasites such as green slime. This spell does
not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease.

**Curse of Swine**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 20m

Duration: 1 day per Sorcery skill rank

This spell transforms 3 targets per Sorcery skill rank into pigs for the
spell's duration. The targets may attempt to throw INT 10+ to avoid this
effect. Targets who fail this throw immediately assume the form –
physical and mental – of a pig, including the mentality of a hog. The
target will not remember their regular life while in swine form and will
act as normal pigs for the duration of this spell. Once the spell
expires, the target regains its original form, intelligence, and
memories. Note that undead, incorporeal or gaseous creatures, or
creatures with natural shapeshifting abilities are immune to this spell.

**Darkness**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 40m

Duration: 1 day + 1 day per rank in Sorcery

The spell creates a spherical region of darkness and shadow around the
target location or object, darkening a 10m radius from it, as dark as a
moonless night. The effect is immobile if cast on an area but mobile if
cast on an object.

**Deathless Minion**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 10m

Duration: 1 hour

This spell raises the bones or flesh of a single dead creature within
range into an undead skeleton or zombie (depending on the corpse's
state). See the Monsters chapter for these monsters' stats. However,
unlike **animate dead**, this spell only lasts for one hour, after which
the undead minion crumbles to dust.

**Death Spell**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 75m

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell will kill 1D man-sized creatures or one larger creature per
the sorcerer's Sorcery skill ranks, within a 10m radius sphere centered
on any point the sorcerer wishes within range. Each affected creature
must throw END 12+ or die immediately.

**Destroy Dead**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 50m

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell destroys the bones or body of a single undead skeleton,
zombie, or ghoul, which immediately crumbles to dust. If the spell is
cast on an inanimate body or skeleton, they crumble as well. This spell
has no effect on the living or on undead other than skeletons, zombies,
or ghouls.

**Detect Invisible**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 20m

Duration: 6 turns

This spell allows the sorcerer to see invisible characters, creatures,
or objects, as translucent shapes, within the spell's range.

**Disintegrate**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 20m

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell targets a single creature or object (up to a cube 3m on a
side), which is entirely disintegrated, leaving nothing but dust behind,
including the creature’s carried equipment. A target creature may throw
END 10+ to avoid being disintegrated. A creature making this throw still
suffers 3D damage Objects, obviously, do not enjoy such throws.

**Dispel Evil**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 10m

Duration: 1 turn

The sorcerer must concentrate for the entire duration for this spell to
work. All undead or summoned creatures within a 10m radius from the
sorcerer must throw END 8+ or crumble to dust. Summoned creatures return
to whence they came instead. Any creatures successfully making that
throw will flee the affected area. Alternatively, instead of affecting a
10m radius, the sorcerer may direct the spell at a single monster, which
will have to make an END 10+ throw instead or be destroyed.
Additionally, **dispel evil** may remove a curse from a single creature
or object in range; doing so ends the spell.

**Dispel Magic**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 40m

Duration: Instantaneous

The sorcerer can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells or magical
effects cast on a creature or objects, or all ongoing spells within a
cubic space 5m on a side (sorcerer's choice).

If the spell targets a creature, all spells and spell-like effects
(including ongoing potion effects) are cancelled. If cast at an area,
all ongoing spells in that area are dispelled.

Some spells are immune to dispel magic, for example, all magical
diseases and curses, and the results of the **flesh to stone** spell.

**Divination**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Self

Duration: Special

Like **augury** but far more powerful, the **divination** spell can
provide the sorcerer with a useful piece of advice concerning a specific
goal, event, or activity which is to occur within one week. Note that if
the sorcerer does not act on this information, actual events may change,
and the information may become irrelevant. The Referee secretly throws
Sorcery 6+ using the spellcaster's skill; if successful, the information
is correct; if failed, the information is false.

**Drain Life**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: touch

Duration: Instantaneous

The sorcerer drains life energy from the target creature to heal
themselves. The spellcaster must touch the target’s skin; touching a
resisting target requires the regular Melee Combat 8+ attack throw. If
the attack hits, the target suffers 4D damage. If the target succeeds,
it suffers only 2D damage. In either case, the sorcerer is
simultaneously healed by half the amount of characteristic points the
target loses, to the maximum of the sorcerer's initial characteristics.

**Ensorcellement**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 10m

Duration: 12 rounds

The sorcerer mesmerizes a single humanoid creature. The target must
throw INT 8+ or be mesmerized. A mesmerized creature cannot attack, cast
spells, move, or speak. It always loses initiative and Surprise rolls,
and attacking it is at DM+2 to hit. The ensorcellement ends when the
creature is slain, the effect is **dispelled**, or the duration expires.

**Faerie fire**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 30m

Duration: 3 rounds per Sorcery skill rank

With this spell, the sorcerer outlines one creature per Sorcery skill
rank with a pale, flickering, cold "fire", which does not inflict
damage, but renders the creature obviously visible (in case it is
invisible or otherwise hidden). Anyone attacking a creature with Faerie
Fire on it gains a DM+2 bonus to hit.

**Feeblemind**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 60m

Duration: Permanent

The target of this spell must throw INT 10+. On a success, the spell has
no effect. On failure, the target becomes a helpless idiot incapable of
casting spells, understanding language, communicating coherently, or
fighting effectively. The victim only dimly remembers who its friends
are and may follow their simple instructions. This state lasts until
**dispelled** or until **restoration** is cast on the victim.

**Flesh to Ashes**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 30m

Duration: Instantaneous

The target creature must throw END 8+ or immediately turn to ashes. Only
living creatures made from flesh may be targeted by this spell.

**Flesh to Stone**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 40m

Duration: Permanent

The spell causes the target creature, together with its carried
equipment to turn into a mindless, inert statue. Targets may throw END
10+ to avoid the effect. If the statue resulting from this spell is
broken or damaged, the target creature, if ever returned to its original
state, suffers equivalent damage or deformities. Only creatures made of
flesh are vulnerable to this spell. **Dispel magic** or **restoration**
will not return the target creature back to flesh; only a **stone to
flesh** spell will reverse this effect.

**Globe of Invulnerability**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 0m

Duration: 3 rounds per Sorcery skill level

This spell creates a magical sphere of protection in a 1.5m radius
around the spellcaster. The globe of invulnerability prevents any spells
of the 4<sup>th</sup> Circle or lesser Circles from penetrating and
harming the caster and anyone else in the sphere. Note that this spell
only grants invulnerability from spells, not from physical attacks.
However, unlike **anti-magic shell**, the **globe of invulnerability**
allows the sorcerer to freely cast spells *out* from the globe. The
**globe of invulnerability** may be **dispelled**.

**Glyph of Warding**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: Touch

Duration: Special

This powerful rune harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded
object, such as a bridge, a passage, a chest, and so on. The maximum
area that can be warded by the spell is a 5m x 5m square per Sorcery
skill level. A password is set upon casting the spell, and any creature
entering or touching the warded area or opening the warded object
without speaking it activates the spell. **Glyph of Warding** either
activates a blast or a stored spell.

*Blast glyph:* the glyph causes 1D damage per Sorcery skill level of the
caster, either fire or electric damage, as chosen by the sorcerer upon
casting. The subject may throw DEX 8+ to reduce the damage by half
(rounded up).

*Spell glyph:* the glyph triggers a magical trap consisting of any spell
that the sorcerer also knows. The glyph is charged with the trap spell
much in the same manner as a focus can be charged with a spell. Popular
choices include, but are not limited to, **cause disease**, **bestow
curse**, and **hold person**.

**Hallucinatory Terrain**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 75m

Duration: Special

This spell creates an illusion that turns an area of outdoor terrain
into a different type: such as a field into a forest or a quagmire into
a meadow. The entire terrain feature must be within the spell's range.
The illusion affects the senses of vision, hearing, and smell. The spell
ends when **dispelled** or when an intelligent creature enters the area
or touches it.

**Haste**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 75m

Duration: 3 turns

The spell greatly accelerates two creatures, doubling the number of
actions they may normally take per round. Up to two creatures per the
caster’s Sorcery skill level can be affected. The hastened creatures
enjoy twice as many actions per combat round, meaning that they could
attack up to four times, or move up to 40m in one six-second round.
Frenzy results and grapples are dealt with accordingly. Note that
spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the use of magical items, which
still may only be used once per round. This spell ages each of its
affected targets by one year, each time it is cast. This may result in
the targets having to make Aging throws.

**Hypnotic Pattern**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 10m

Duration: Concentration

The sorcerer creates a mesmerizing pattern of color and light in the
air. Any creature seeing the pattern becomes mesmerized unless they
throw INT 8+. Affected creatures will stand motionless without action
and may not even parry or dodge. The effect lasts as long as the
sorcerer concentrates on it or until **dispelled**.

**Hold Person**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 100m

Duration: 9 turns

This spell paralyzes any living humanoid being, including winged ones,
freezing them in place like living statues. The target may make a STR 8+
throw to avoid the effect of this spell. The caster may paralyze one
target, plus one additional target per Sorcery skill level. A held
target is aware and may breathe normally but cannot take any action nor
speak.

A winged creature which is held during flight falls. A paralyzed swimmer
cannot swim and sinks – and will drown without any outside assistance.

**Hold Monster**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 100m

Duration: 3D turns

This spell functions like **hold person**, except that it affects any
living creature which fails an STR 8+ throw.

**Ice Storm**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 75m

Duration: 1 turn

This spell calls down a storm of freezing, razor-sharp hail from the
heavens on a target location no more than 6m in diameter. Any creature
or object beginning their combat round in, or entering into the ice
storm must throw DEX 8+ or suffer 2D damage per caster's Sorcery skill
rank. A second successful DEX 8+ throw halves this damage (round down).
Any movement through an **ice storm**'s area is at half the normal
movement rate.

If cast underground or inside a building, the storm will strike the
ceiling or the surface above the desired target area; it will reach the
target only if it does enough damage to break through to it.

The sorcerer gains a DM+2 when casting this spell in icy or stormy
weather. If cast under a clear sky, the sorcerer is incurs a DM-2
penalty to the throw.

**Immunity to Elements**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Touch

Duration: 6 turns

This spell grants one creature complete immunity to one elemental force:
cold, electricity, or fire for its duration. The immunity also protects
any items the creature is carrying.

**Invisibility**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: Touch

Duration: Until dispelled or until the subject attacks someone or
something

The creature touched becomes invisible. Any equipment or items carried
by the target creature vanishes as well. Items dropped by the invisible
creature turn visible, and items picked up by it becomes invisible. Note
that the subject is not magically silenced, only turned invisible. The
spell ends after the invisible creature attacks any creature or casts
any spell. Other actions do not end the spell. The spell lasts 24 hours,
or until the caster dispels the effect.

**Kindle flame**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 5m

Duration: Instantaneous

The sorcerer causes one or more flammable objects within range to burst
into flame, even if they are wet. All target objects must be within a
1.5m radius sphere. The spell may also be used to attack, by igniting a
target’s clothes or other flammable items on their person. The target
must throw DEX 8+ suffer 2D damage per round. The target continues to
take 2D damage per round, until they make a DEX 8+ roll to extinguish
the flames, or immerse themselves in water.

**Knock**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 20m

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell opens stuck, barred, and locked doors, as well as boxes,
chests, and other locked objects. This includes magically locked items.
**Knock** will not raise a portcullis, operate drawbridges or similar
mechanisms, or affect ropes, vines, etc. Apply DM-1 to the spellcasting
roll when dealing with a magical lock.

**Levitate**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Touch

Duration: 6 turns + 2 turns per Sorcery skill level

This spell allows the sorcerer to move the touched creature or object up
or down. It only affects willing creatures or unattended objects. By
concentrating, the sorcerer can direct the subject up and down by as
much as 5m per round. This spell does not allow horizontal travel, but
the target may clamber or push themselves against surfaces to move
laterally.

**Magic Jar**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 10m

Duration: Special

By casting **magic jar**, the sorcerer deposits their soul inside an
inanimate object in the spell's range (the eponymous "**magic jar**").
The sorcerer may then attempt to possess a nearby living being within
40m of the **magic jar**, forcing the target’s soul into the jar
instead. The sorcerer may move back to the jar (and hence returning the
trapped soul to its original body) and attempt to possess another living
creature. The spell ends when the sorcerer returns to their own body,
leaving the jar empty.

When the spellcaster transfers their soul to the receptacle, their body
appears dead, but does not decay as a normal dead body would.

Wards such as **protection from evil** block this spell. Otherwise, the
target must throw INT 8+ or be possessed by the sorcerer's dark soul. On
a successful throw, the sorcerer's soul remains in the jar and the same
target is immune to further possession attempts for one Day.

If the target fails this throw, their soul is trapped within the **magic
jar**, and the sorcerer possesses their body. The sorcerer keeps their
INT, EDU, skills, and mental abilities. The body retains its STR, DEX,
END, SOC, as well as natural abilities. The sorcerer has no access to
any special abilities or skills of that body.

If the jar is broken or **dispelled** when the sorcerer's soul is within
it, and the sorcerer's body is within 40m of the jar, the sorcerer's
spirit returns to their original body. Otherwise, the sorcerer's spirit
goes to the underworld and the body dies. In any case, the spell ends.

The **dispel evil** spell exorcises the sorcerer's soul from a host
body. If the **magic jar** is within 40m of the body, the caster's
spirit returns to the jar, and the host's spirit to its body. The
sorcerer will be unable to possess the same body within the next turn.
If the jar is outside this range, both souls – that of the sorcerer and
that of the host – go to the underworld, and both bodies die.

If the possessed host's spirit is within the jar and the jar breaks or
is **dispelled**, and the jar is within 40m of the possessed body, the
host's spirit returns to their body while the sorcerer's soul goes to
the underworld. If it is outside range, the disembodied spirit goes to
the underworld.

**Mind Probe**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 20m

Duration: 12 turns

The spell permits the sorcerer to read the surface thoughts one or more
targets within range. The caster must designate a direction in which
they "listen"; each turn, the sorcerer may "listen" in a different
direction. The sorcerer will understand any target's surface thoughts
regardless of language. Targets are not aware of this kind of probing.

Two or more inches of rock, or a thin coating of lead or gold, will
block this spell. All undead – including intelligent ones – are immune
to this spell, as are all mindless creatures.

**Mirage**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 75m

Duration: Special

This spell makes a structure or terrain feature look like something
else, such as transforming a tower into a hill. The entire terrain
feature must be within the spell's range. The affected terrain looks,
sounds, and smells exactly like the illusory form. Intelligent creatures
who suspect that this is an illusion may throw INT 8+ to disbelieve it.
The mirage lasts until **dispelled**.

**Mirror Image**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: Self

Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates several illusory duplicates of the sorcerer. The
images move through each other, as well as through the actual sorcerer,
quite often, so it is impossible for any creature to know which one of
them is the real spellcaster. This creates a total of 1D+2 images, which
cluster around the sorcerer. The figments mimic the caster's motions.

Attacks against the caster will always target one figment instead,
whether the attack is successful or not. Any attack on a figment
destroys it. However, until all figments are removed, or until the
effect is **dispelled**, or the spell expires, the sorcerer cannot not
be harmed by melee or ranged attacks.

**Move Earth**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 75m

Duration: 6 turns

With this spell, the sorcerer can move large volumes of soil, up to 10m
x 10m x 10m in volume, including altering surface features within range.
The sorcerer may move earth at a rate of 20m per turn, as desired. The
spell cannot affect stone, only soil.

**Neutralize Poison**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

The spell neutralizes any poison in the touched creature or object. This
includes all magical poisons. If cast on a poisoned creature, it suffers
no further damage. If cast on a poisoned object, the poison is removed.
If cast on a creature that died from poisoning in the last 10 rounds,
the target is revived with a score of 1 in all physical characteristics.

**Noxious Cloud**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 30m

Duration: 3 rounds per Sorcery skill level

The sorcerer creates a cloud of foul-smelling vapors within 10m of a
target chosen by the caster. The spell draws it power from natural
miasmas and thus can only be cast outdoors or in a ventilated room. The
cloud is 5m x 5m x 5m in size and blocks line of sight into or through
it. Any creature starting its initiative within the cloud or moving into
it must throw END 8+ or became nauseated. Nauseated creatures cannot
attack, cast spells, or take any action except for move out of the
cloud. The nauseated condition lasts as long as the creature is in the
cloud and 1D rounds after exiting it. Any creature that succeeds in the
END 8+ throw but remains in the cloud or re-enters it must make this
throw again or be affected as long as the cloud persists.

**Phantasmal Force**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 75m

Duration: Concentration

This spell creates a visual illusion of any object, creature, or force
imagined by the sorcerer, up to a maximum volume of 5m x 5m x 5m. This
illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The
spellcaster can move the image within this volume and the spell lasts as
long as the sorcerer concentrates on it, or until it is **dispelled**.

If used to simulate creatures, the illusions will disappear if it is
successfully hit in combat. If simulating an attack, the illusory damage
will be equivalent damage of such attack, though an INT 8+ throw by the
target will void this damage. The damage, in any case, is unreal; those
"killed" or "injured" by this spell fall unconscious and will awake
within 1D rounds, without a scratch.

**Pillar of Fire**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 50m

Duration: Instantaneous

The sorcerer calls forth a 15m high, 5m diameter column of fire from the
heavens and unleashes it upon the target location. This deals 4D damage
to all creatures in the area of effect. Creatures who successfully throw
DEX 8+ suffer only 2D damage.

If cast underground or inside a building, the pillar will strike the
ceiling or the surface above the desired area of effect; it will reach
its destination only if it breaks through it.

**Pillar of fire** may damage vehicles – it has an AV value of 5D and
will almost certainly set wooden ships on fire.

**Poison**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

When casting this spell, the sorcerer must attack a target; if the
attack is successful, the target is poisoned and must resist a Virulence
10+, Damage 4D poison.

**Protection from Chaos**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Self

Duration: Concentration

This spell creates a magical barrier protecting the sorcerer and those
within a 3m radius. For its duration, those in the area of effect are
afforded some protection against Chaotic beings such as the undead or
demons. The spell causes Chaotic targets DM-1 to hit the protected
characters. It also prevents direct bodily contact with Chaotic beings.
Natural weapon attacks by Chaotic beings fail; this does not affect
weapon attacks, ranged attacks, or spells, however.

The caster must remain stationary and concentrate on the spell.

The spell ends immediately if any protected creature tries to cast
another spell or attack Chaotic beings; if the caster moves; or if the
caster loses concentration, such as by casting another spell or being
injured..

**Purify food and water**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 3m

Duration: Instantaneous

The spell makes spoiled, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and
water pure and ready for consumption. This spell will purify enough food
and water to sustain a dozen humans or human-sized creatures for one
day. The spell, however, cannot affect poisons.

**Rebirth**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

In this vile act of necromancy, the sorcerer attempts to steal a dead
person's soul, dragging it back from the halls of the dead. This is one
of the darkest black magic spells in existence, because the gods of the
dead see this as a personal insult. There is no need for a dead body;
the spell will materialize the dead soul in new flesh. However, this
spell is highly risky. Upon a successful casting, throw 2D on the
following table and add the spellcasting throw's Effect:

| **2D** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2      | The gods refuse to let go of the character's soul and they remain dead for eternity. No further attempts may be made to bring the character back to life.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3-4    | The character indeed arises from the dead, but instead of rising as a normal mortal, the eternal powers of Chaos curse them with undeath! The character rises as a **ghoul**, under the Referee's control, who will attack any nearby characters and attempt to eat them.                                                                       |
| 5-6    | The spell fails. Further **rebirth** attempts may be made, but at DM-2 on this table. Penalties are cumulative for repeated attempts, e.g. a third attempt after failing twice will suffer DM-4.                                                                                                                                                |
| 7-9    | The character is restored to life, but in a bad state – they will require 1D months of rest. Roll 1D: 1-2, the character loses their memory; 3-4, the character is part alive and part dead; 5-6, the character will suffer from sudden and unexpected fits of murderous rage (see below).                                                      |
| 10     | The character is restored to life, though still bearing terrible injuries – they will require 1D months of rest. Roll 1D: 1-2 the character suffers from partial memory loss; 3-4, the character has passed through Hell and will have severe recurring nightmares; 5-6, the character undergoes a profound personality change as they recover. |
| 11     | The character is well-restored to life and will make a full recovery within 2 weeks. Roll 1D: 1-2, the character will be sickly for the rest of their life; 3-4, the character suffers characteristic loss ;5-6, the character remains cold as a corpse and will suffer sudden shivers.                                                         |
| 12+    | The character is blessed by Chaos and awakens fully restored with full characteristics, ready to adventure at a moment’s notice!                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

**Rebirth Effects:**

*Characteristic Loss:* the character loses 1D points from one
characteristic, chosen randomly, to a minimum of 1.

*Memory Loss, Full:* The character suffers from complete amnesia, though
they will retain basic life skills and partial adventuring capabilities.
The character loses half of their skill levels, chosen by the Referee.
The character's EDU characteristic is halved (round up).

*Memory Loss, Partial:* The character loses part of their memory but
retains a general idea of their identity, as well as some adventuring
capabilities. The character loses one skill entirely, regardless of
level, chosen randomly. The character also loses 1D points of EDU.

*Partially Alive:* The character is neither alive nor dead, and teeters
constantly on death's door, held alive only by black magic but at the
same time is constantly called back to the afterlife (or hell) by the
gods of death. The character suffers DM-2 to all actions and only has
half their movement rate. The character must also throw END 8+ every
month, with the above penalty, or die as the gods of the underworld
reclaim their soul.

*Personality Change:* The character retains their memories, but his or
her personality will change in a profound manner, as negotiated between
player and Referee.

*Recurring Nightmares:* The character suffers from memories of being
dead in a dreadful afterlife – as well as other negative visions. They
will invariable suffer from severe recurring nightmares every night,
preventing healthy sleep. The character will suffer severe insomnia as a
result, causing a perpetual DM-1 to all actions.

*Sickly:* The character's body does not fully recover from being dead
and its life force is far weaker. Natural healing takes twice as long,
and so does magical healing based on natural healing times (such as
**cure wounds** spells). The character also suffers DM-1 to throws to
resist disease, poison, or acid.

*Sudden Murderous Rage:* The character awakens as normal but is shadowed
by a demon. At the Referee's discretion (recommended every week or every
month), the character must make throw INT 8+ or fly into murderous
bloodlust lasting 2D rounds, doing their best to kill any living being
within reach. After this period, they will return to normal, but will
not remember any of their actions while enraged. A sorcerer may attempt
to use **remove curse** to exorcize the demon; in this case, the
character throws INT 8+; if successful, the sorcerer drives away the
demon and prevents any further bouts of rage; if failed, the character
becomes permanently controlled by the demon – and from that point on is
considered an NPC monster controlled by the Referee.

**Remove curse**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 10m

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell instantaneously removes all curses from a single creature. If
cast on a cursed item, the spell does not remove the curse from the item
itself but allows the item's bearer to get rid of it.

**Remove fear**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (White)

Range: touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell calms down and removes fear from a touched creature,
including magical fear.

**Resist Elements**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (White)

Range: touch

Duration: 6 turns

This spell grants a single creature temporary immunity to cold, fire, or
electricity (the sorcerer chooses one of them upon casting the spell).
The target ignored ordinary exposure to this element (such as exposure
to arctic weather with inadequate clothing). The target also gains DM+2
to throws to resist more significant forms of that element, such as an
ice dragon's cold breath or a **call lightning** spell.

**Respite**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

The subject heals as if they have rested for one full day.

**Restoration**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

The spell removes any curses, afflictions, diseases, or poisons from the
creature the sorcerer touches.

This spell may also allow a creature to regrow lost limbs or organs,
thus reversing mortal wounds, assuming that the creature is still alive.
However, such rapid regeneration wracks the targets body; the creature
must throw END 8+ or be forced to roll on the Mutation Table.

This spell cannot cure mutations, and nor can it bring dead creatures
back to life.

**Scrying**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: Special

Duration: 1 turn

This spell allows the sorcerer to see images of distant creatures,
objects, or places. This requires a mirror, a crystal, or a clear pool,
upon which the visions will be seen. The caster must know the creature,
object, or place viewed, or have a sample of the creature or object such
as hair clipping or paint chip. The vision lasts 1 turn and the sorcerer
must remain concentrated and motionless while scrying.

**Sleep**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 20m

Duration: 3D turns

The sorcerer attempts to put living creatures into a magical sleep. The
caster may affect two visible creatures per Sorcery skill level. Each
target must throw END 8+ or fall asleep and become helpless. Ranged
attacks against the sleeping creature are at DM+2, and if an attacker is
not engaged in combat with another creature, they may slay a sleeping
creature automatically. Attacking, damaging, or otherwise moving a
sleeping creature awakens them.

**Smite Undead**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 75m

Duration: Special

This spell instantly destroys a number of undead creatures within range
equal to three times the sorcerer's Sorcery skill. All undead must be
inside a 20m radius sphere from a point of origin chosen by the
sorcerer. Skeletons and zombies turn to dust automatically. Other undead
must throw END 8+ or crumble to dust. Undead with the Sorcery skill,
such as vampires, are immune to this spell.

**Snake Charm**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 20m

Duration: Special

The sorcerer can affect the behavior of snakes. This spell makes
targeted snakes indifferent to the spellcaster and any allies. The
sorcerer can affect a number of snakes equal to twice their Sorcery
skill level. The snakes will defend themselves if attacked, but
otherwise will be indifferent to everyone but their attackers. Attacking
one charmed snake will not break the charm on others.

If cast on snakes engaged in melee combat, the spell will last for 2D
rounds. If cast on snakes which are not hostile at the moment, it will
last for 1D turns.

The sorcerer may command the charmed snakes to attack a target, for the
duration given above.

**Speak with animals**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (White)

Range: special

Duration: 6 turns

The sorcerer can comprehend and communicate with any one normal or giant
animal within line of sight capable of hearing the spellcaster. It does
not affect intelligent animals or fantastic creatures. This spell does
not automatically change the animal's attitude towards the sorcerer, it
only allows communication.

**Speak with Dead**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 5m

Duration 1 turn

This spell grants a semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse,
allowing it to answer several questions that the sorcerer asks. The
spellcaster may as two questions per Sorcery skill level. The corpse's
knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including
any languages it spoke. Answers are typically brief, cryptic, or
repetitive. The corpse must have a mouth in order to respond. The spell
does not work on undead—even dead undead. Only one **speak with dead**
spell will affect a given corpse in a week.

**Speak with Plants**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 10m

Duration: 3 turns

The sorcerer can communicate with both normal plants and plant
creatures. A normal plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, and
thus it will have a limited ability to answer questions about events
outside its immediate vicinity. The spell does not alter the plant's
reaction towards the sorcerer; however, normal plants often communicate
freely with sorcerers, as they have little else important to do but the
ordinary eternity of photosynthesis. To determine the attitudes of
sentient plant creatures towards the sorcerer, follow the normal
Reaction rules. Friendly plant creatures may assist the sorcerer in
various tasks; ordinary plants may only converse.

**Starfall**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 75m

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell calls down a star from the vast reaches of dark space to
strike a point of the sorcerer's choice, where it explodes for 4D damage
per the sorcerer's Sorcery skill rank. The damage is applied to every
creature within a 5m-radius sphere. The spell also has AV 4D when
targeting vehicles. Creatures in the area of effect may throw DEX 8+ to
reduce this damage by half. The explosion also ignites any flammable
material within its radius and may melt metals with a low melting point,
such as gold or silver. Note that if any object, such as a ceiling,
blocks the meteorite's fall, it will explode prematurely. However, the
spell might cause damage indirectly from falling debris as the ceiling
collapses.

**Sticks to Snakes**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 40m

Duration: 6 turns

The spell transforms 2D ordinary wooden sticks per Sorcery skill rank
into normal venomous snakes (see the Monsters chapter). The snakes
follow the sorcerer's commands. The snakes revert to wooden sticks when
slain, **dispelled**, or when the spell ends.

**Stone to Flesh**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 40m

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell brings a petrified creature back to life, reversing, for
example, the **flesh to stone** spell or petrification effect caused by
various monsters. If it is cast on stone which is not a petrified
creature, it will merely transform a human-sized volume of stone into a
gooey pile of primordial organic matter.

**Summon insect swarm**

2<sup>nd</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 5m

Duration: 1 day

The sorcerer calls forth an **insect swarm** (see the Monsters chapter),
which forms anywhere within range. The swarm will mindlessly respond to
the sorcerer's will. It will dissipate when **dispelled**, or when the
spell ends.

**Summon Hell Hounds**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 5m

Duration: Special

The sorcerer conjures 2D **hell hounds** from the depths of hell. The
hounds appear anywhere within range. When summoned, the sorcerer must
give the hounds a single task, such as guarding a location, or hunting a
particular creature. The spell ends when the hounds complete their task,
or when a month passes – whichever is earlier. Hell hounds are hateful
creatures of Chaos, and thus will interpret commands in the most
destructive manner possible. The hounds will disappear when the spell
ends, when they are slain, or when they are **dispelled**.

**Summon Invisible Stalker**

6<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 5m

Duration: Special

The sorcerer calls forth an **invisible stalker** from the Outer Dark to
do his vile bidding. When summoned, the invisible stalker must receive a
single objective, such as guarding a location or hunting a particular
creature. The spell expires once the task is complete. However,
**invisible stalkers** resent protracted missions and will seek to
pervert their instructions accordingly. The creature will vanish when
destroyed, **dispelled**, or when the task is complete. Because of the
soul-blasting nature of this spell, a sorcerer cannot cast it more than
once a week.

**Summon Ooze**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 5m

Duration: 1 day

The sorcerer calls forth their choice of gray ooze, green slime, or
yellow mold from the darkest recesses of the Earth (see the Monsters for
details). The ooze will mindlessly respond to the sorcerer's will. It
will disappear when **dispelled**, or when the spell ends. Because the
soul-wrenching nature of this spell, it cannot be cast more than once a
day.

**Summon Shadows**

4<sup>th</sup> Circle (Black)

Range: 5m

Duration: 1 week

The sorcerer calls forth 1D **shadows** from the Outer Dark to serve
her. The shadows appear anywhere within range and respond to the
spellcaster's will, as well as the shadows spawned by them, to a total
maximum of 6 shadows. Note that shadows are inimical to all life and
will try to twist any order to wreak maximum possible havoc. The shadows
vanish when **dispelled** or when the spell ends. Note that due to the
soul-wrecking nature of this spell, it may only be cast once every week.

**Summon Weather**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 10km per Sorcery skill rank

Duration: 3 hours per Sorcery skill rank

The spell calls forth and creates a specific weather condition to the
sorcerer's location, regardless of the local naturally-occurring
weather. It does not control this weather, merely summons it. The
weather arrives within 1 turn.

This spell is particularly potent when combined with **call lightning**,
a combination sometimes called the *Storm of the Century*.

**Telepathy**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 30m

Duration: Concentration

This spell allows the sorcerer to read the thoughts of any creature
within 30m at will. The spellcaster may also send a telepathic message
to any character whose thoughts they are reading, which allows for
bidirectional communication. While using this spell, the sorcerer must
concentrate and cannot otherwise move or act.

**Thunderclap**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 20m

Duration: Instantaneous

A deafening thunder resounds from a point of the sorcerer’s choosing,
within range. This may be heard up to 10km away as a low rumble. Any
creatures within 1.5m of the **thunderclap**'s chosen center must throw
DEX 8+ or suffer 1D damage and be deafened for 1D turns. Deafened
creatures suffer DM-2 to Surprise and Stealth rolls, as well as to any
Spellcasting throw.

**Tremor**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: Special

Duration: Concentration

This spell causes the ground around the sorcerer to tremble. The
sorcerer remains unaffected. The spellcaster may choose to have the
**tremor** radiate outward from them along the ground in all directions
up to a radius of 15m, or blast outward along the ground in a flat cone
45m long and 30m wide. Creatures within the area of effect must throw
DEX 8+ every round. Those who fail this throw are knocked down and
suffer 1D damage. Those who succeed retain their footing and suffer no
damage. At the Referee's discretion, **tremor** may damage buildings and
has an AV 5D ability vs. vehicles. Note that a sorcerer may only cast
this spell on the ground; Casting this spell in deep water creates a
small tsunami, which may cause the AV 5D attack vs. ships!

**True Seeing**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Touch

Duration: 6 turns

The spell confers the subject with the ability to see all things as they
are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices
secret doors, sees invisible creatures and objects, sees through
illusions, normal and magical disguises, and various polymorph effects.
This sight has a 50m range but does not penetrate solid objects and does
not negate actual concealment such as fog (even magically conjured fog).

**Unseen servant**

1<sup>st</sup> Circle (Grey)

Range: 10m

Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn per Sorcery skill level

The sorcerer summons an invisible, mindless, shapeless force to act as a
valet. It can fetch items, open doors, hold chairs, clean, and perform
other similar simple tasks. It can exert up to 10kg of force and thus
can trigger traps, if desired, or deliver bombs to enemy positions. A
**dispel magic** ends this effect, but the "servant" is immune to
ordinary attacks.

**Water Breathing**

3<sup>rd</sup> Circle (White)

Range: 10m

Duration: 1 day

This spell allows the target to breathe underwater at any depth; it does
not prevent the target from breathing air, nor does it provide any
special ability to move underwater.

**Winged Flight**

5<sup>th</sup> Circle (White)

Range: Self

Duration: 3 turns per Sorcery skill level

The sorcerer grows two large wings from their shoulders; their
appearance can be determined at the spellcaster's discretion. The wings
allow the spellcaster to fly at a rate of 40m per combat round, or 2000m
per turn while exploring. Flight requires no more concentration than
walking, and the sorcerer may attack or cast spells normally. If
**winged flight** is dispelled or ends when the sorcerer is aloft, they
will fall to the ground, potentially taking falling damage.

# CHAPTER 6: EQUIPMENT

The following section lists examples of common equipment that
adventurers may want. Aside from armor and weapons, each listing notes
the object's name and a basic description. The technological level
indicates local technology required to manufacture something with the
capabilities listed. Price and weight are for an item manufactured by an
interstellar society of tech level 10-15; items produced at lower tech
levels will probably be bulkier and more expensive. An item with no
weight or size given can be carried or worn without difficulty.
Additional lines of explanation are given where considered necessary.

## Technology Level Overview

Technology Level, also known as Tech Level or TL, is a measure of the
scientific and production capacity of a world and the complexity and
effectiveness of a piece of equipment.

#### Table: Technology Level Overview

| TL     | Descriptor      | Notable Characteristics                                                                                                                                                         |

| 3      | Primitive       | Mass production allows for product standardization, bringing the germ of industrial revolution and steam power.                                                                 |
| 4      | Industrial      | Transition to industrial revolution is complete, bringing plastics, radio and other such inventions.                                                                            |
| 5      | Industrial      | Widespread electrification, tele-communications and internal combustion.                                                                                                        |

| 8      | Pre-Stellar     | Possible to reach other worlds in the same system, although terraforming or full colonization is not within the culture’s capacity.                                             |
| 9      | Pre-Stellar     | Development of gravity manipulation, which makes space travel vastly safer and faster; first steps into Jump Drive technology.                                                  |
| 10 (A) | Early Stellar   | With the advent of Jump, nearby systems are opened up.                                                                                                                          |

Higher Technology Levels exist and may appear in some Märchen Engine
universes.

## Currency

The Crown (Cr) is the standard unit of currency in Märchen Engine.
Larger denominations include the KiloCrown (K₢; 1,000 Crowns) and the
MegaCrown (M₢; 1,000,000 Crowns).

## Armor

Armor reduces the amount of damage a character takes from a hit, based
on the type of armor worn. The armor rating for a set of armor is equal
to the amount of damage reduced by the armor when you are hit in combat.
A hit with Effect 6+ always inflicts at least one point of damage,
regardless of the target’s armor.

Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armor can be worn at a time.
Resolve damage from the outside in – damage that gets through the outer
layer of armor is next applied to the inner layer.

**TL**: The earliest tech level at which this item first becomes
available.

**Armor Rating (AR)**: The amount of damage reduced by the armor when an
attack strikes the character. When two values are listed separated by a
slash, the number to the left of the slash represents the armor rating
against all attacks except lasers, while the number to the right of the
slash represents the armor rating against laser attacks.

**Cost**: The cost of the item in Crowns (Cr).

**Weight**: The weight of the item in kilograms.

**Skill Required**: Some armors have a required skill. A character
suffers the usual unskilled penalty when using armor without levels in
the required skill.

#### Table: Common Personal Armor

| Armor                 | TL  | AR    | Cost     | Wgt  | Skill Required |
|-----------------------|-----|-------|----------|------|----------------|

### Armor Descriptions

**Ablat** (TL 9): A cheap alternative to Reflec, ablat armor is made
from a material that ablates (vaporizes) when hit by laser fire. Each
laser hit on ablat reduces its armor value (versus lasers) by one, but
the armor is cheap and easily replaceable.

**Battle Dress** (TL 13): The ultimate personal armor, battle dress is a
powered form of combat armor. The servomotors vastly increase the user's
speed and strength, boosting his Strength and Dexterity by +4 while
wearing the armor. Damage to the wearer's characteristics is calculated
as normal, but the values from the armor are used for all other purposes
such as hand to hand damage or skill checks. The suit has a built-in
Model 2 computer running an Expert Tactics-2 program to give tactical
advice and updates and is commonly outfitted with numerous upgrades. The
suit is fully enclosed, with a six-hour air supply and gives full
protection against environmental hazards – including NBC shielding – as
if it was an HEV suit.

**Cloth** (TL 7): A heavy duty body suit tailored from ballistic cloth.
The fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads it over the body, which can
result in bruising. However, cloth armor is highly useful and versatile
– it can be effectively concealed under normal clothing although
observers making an Investigate or Recon check at 8+ will notice
something unusual.

**Combat Armor** (TL 11): This full-body suit is used by the military
and not generally available on the open market, although those with
military or criminal contacts can obtain it without much difficulty. It
is issued to troop units and mercenary battalions. Combat armor protects
from hard vacuum in the same way as a vacc suit and provides life
support for six hours.

**Hostile Environment Vacc Suit** (TL 8): Hostile environment suits are
designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be insufficient,
such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases,
extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer
serious physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere.
HEV suits provide all the life support offered by a normal vacc suit
(for six hours) but are also impervious to flames, intense radiation
such as that found at nuclear blast sites (decreasing radiation exposure
by 180 rads), and high pressure environments like undersea trenches.

**Jack** (TL 1): A natural or synthetic leather jacket or body suit
covering the torso and upper arms and legs.

**Mesh** (TL 6): A jacket or body suit lined with a flexible metal or
plastic mesh that gives it added protection against bullets.

**Reflec** (TL 10): Reflec armor is a flexible plastic suit with layers
of reflective material and heat-dispersing gel. It is highly effective
against lasers, but provides no protection against other attacks. Reflec
can be worn with other armor.

**Vacc Suit** (TL 8): The vacc suit or space suit is the spacer's best
friend, providing life support and protection when in space. A vacc suit
provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of
temperature, low pressure and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum
(decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads), for six hours.

## Communicators

Characters separated by physical location often have a need to maintain
communications. These examples of communications equipment fulfill that
need. Routine use of these devices does not require a skill check. When
attempting to overcome interference or use these devices for other
purposes, the Comms skill check is used.

#### Table: Communications Equipment

| Communicator              | TL  | Cost | Wgt    | Range   |
|---------------------------|-----|------|--------|---------|
| Long Range Communicator   | 6   | ₢500 | 15 kg  | 500 km  |
| Medium Range Communicator | 5   | ₢200 | 10 kg  | 30 km   |
| Short Range Communicator  | 5   | ₢100 | 5 kg   | 10 km   |
| Personal Communicator     | 8   | ₢250 | 0.3 kg | Special |

**Long Range Communicator**: Back-pack mounted radio capable of ranges
up to 500 km and contact with ships in orbit. Ten separate channels. At
tech level 7 reduce the weight to 1.5 kg and it becomes belt or sling
mounted.

**Medium Range Communicator**: Belt-mounted or sling carried radio set
capable of up to 30 km range, and contact with official radio channels.
Five separate channels. At tech level 7, reduce the weight to 500 grams.

**Short Range Communicator**: Belt-mounted radio capable of 10 km range
(much shorter underground or underwater). Three separate channels. At
tech level 7 reduce the weight to 300 grams and it becomes hand-held.

**Personal Communicator**: A hand-held, single channel communication
device. On world with a tech level of 8 or higher a personal
communicator is able to tap into the world's satellite communication
network and with the proper address, contact any other communicator in
the world (for a fee). The channel is private, but not secure and may be
monitored on some worlds. Usually network access can be arranged at the
local starport for a small fee. On worlds with a tech level of 7 or
less, personal communicators will not work.

## Computers

The power of a computer is given by its rating (Model 1, Model 2 and so
forth), which measures the complexity of the programs it can run.
(Storage space is effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above.) Programs are
rated by the computer rating they require. A system can run a number of
programs up to its rating.

The computers listed here are laptop size. Battery life is two hours at
TL 7, eight hours at TL 8, and effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above.
Desktop computers offer a slightly greater amount of processing power
for the same cost but not enough to make a difference in-game. Desktops
become obsolete during TL 8.

#### Table: Computers by TL

| Optimum TL | Computer Power | Mass (kg) | Cost (Cr) |
|------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| TL 7       | Model 0        | 10        | 50        |
| TL 8       | Model 1        | 5         | 100       |
| TL 9       | Model 1        | 5         | 250       |
| TL 10      | Model 2        | 1         | 350       |
| TL 11      | Model 2        | 1         | 500       |
| TL 12      | Model 3        | 0.5       | 1,000     |
| TL 13      | Model 4        | 0.5       | 1,500     |

**Computer Terminal** (TL 7): This is a ‘dumb terminal’, with only
limited processing power. It serves as an interface to a more powerful
computer such as a ship’s computer or planetary network. Terminals range
in size depending on their control method – a holographic display
terminal can be much smaller than one with a physical keyboard and
screen. A computer terminal has Model 0, and costs ₢200.

**Hand Computer** (TL 7): A hand computer is a portable computer system
with considerable processing power. It is more powerful than a computer
terminal, and can be used without access to a network. A hand computer
costs twice as much as a normal computer of the same TL but can he held
in one hand and operated with the other.

### Computer Options

**Data Display/Recorder** (TL 13): This headpiece worn over one or both
eyes provides a continuous heads-up display for the user, allowing him
to view computer data from any linked system. Because of the transparent
screen vision is not obscured while using a DD/R headset. DD/Rs can
display data from any system, not just computers – they can display vacc
suit oxygen reserves, grav belt status, neural activity scanner results
and so forth. ₢5,000.

**Data Wafer** (TL 10): The principle medium of information storage is
the standard data wafer, a rectangle of hardened plastic about the size
of a credit card. A TL 10 data wafer is memory diamond, with information
encoded in structures of carbon atoms; more advanced wafers use more
exotic means of data storage. ₢5.

**Specialized Computer**: A computer can be designed for a specific
purpose, which gives it a Rating of 1 or 2 higher for that program only.
The navigation computer on a starship might be only a Model 1, but it
could run the Expert Navigation/3 program because it is specially
designed for that task. A specialized computer costs 25% more per added
Rating. In addition, when working out how many programs the computer can
run simultaneously, the program that the computer is specialized for
does not count against that total.

### Computer Software

A character can use any high-rating software at a lower rating, to a
minimum of the lowest rating shown.

Programs above Rating/1 cannot be copied easily, as they require a
non-trivial amount of bandwidth to transfer.

## Drugs

Medications often supplement the direct medical attention of a trained
health professional. The following drugs are commonly encountered in
Märchen Engine campaigns.

#### Table: Drugs

| Description           | TL  | Cost   |
|-----------------------|-----|--------|
| Medicinal Drugs       | 5   | ₢5+    |
| Anti-Radiation Drugs  | 8   | ₢1,000 |
| Panaceas              | 8   | ₢200   |
| Stim Drugs            | 8   | ₢50    |
| Combat Drug           | 10  | ₢1,000 |
| Fast Drug             | 10  | ₢200   |
| Metabolic Accelerator | 10  | ₢500   |
| Medicinal Slow Drug   | 11  | ₢500   |
| Anagathics            | 15  | ₢2,000 |

**Anagathics**: Slow the user’s aging process. Synthetic anagathics
become possible at TL 15, but there are natural spices and other rare
compounds that have comparable effects at all Technology Levels.
Anagathics are illegal or heavily controlled on many worlds. One dose
must be taken each month to maintain the anti-aging effect – if the
character taking anagathics misses a dose they must make an immediate
roll on the aging table as their body reacts badly to the interrupted
supply.

**Anti-Radiation Drugs**: Must be administered before or immediately
after (within ten minutes) radiation exposure. They absorb up to 100
rads per dose. A character may only use anti-rad drugs once per day –
taking any more causes permanent Endurance damage of 1D6 per dose.

**Combat Drug**: This drug increases reaction time and improves the
body’s ability to cope with trauma, aiding the user in combat. A
character using a combat drug adds +4 to his initiative total at the
start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge
once each round with no effect on his initiative score and reduces all
damage suffered by two points. The drug kicks in twenty seconds (four
rounds) after injection, and lasts around ten minutes. When the drug
wears off, the user is fatigued.

**Fast Drug**: Also known as 'Hibernation', this drug puts the user into
a state akin to suspended animation, slowing his metabolic rate down to
a ratio of 60 to 1 – a subjective day for the user is actually two
months. Fast drug is normally used to prolong life support reserves or
as a cheap substitute for a cryoberth.

**Medicinal Drugs**: These medications include vaccines, antitoxins and
antibiotics. They range in cost from ₢5 to 1D6x1,000 Crowns, depending
on the rarity and complexity of the drug. Medicinal drugs require the
Medic skill to use properly – using the wrong drug can be worse than
doing nothing. With a successful Medic check the correct drug can
counteract most poisons or diseases, or at the very least give a
positive DM towards resisting them. If the wrong drug is administered,
treat it as a Difficult (–2 DM) poison with a damage of 1D6.

**Medicinal Slow**: A variant of the slow drug. It can only be applied
safely in a medical facility where life-support and cryo-technology is
available as it increases the metabolism to around thirty times normal,
allowing a patient to undergo a month of healing in a single day.

**Metabolic Accelerator**: Also known as 'Slow Drug', this drug boosts
the user’s reaction time to superhuman levels. A character using slow
drug in combat adds +8 to his initiative total at the start of combat
(or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge up to twice each
round with no effect on his initiative score. The drug kicks in 45
seconds (eight rounds) after ingestion or injection and lasts for around
ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user’s system crashes. He
suffers 2D6 points of damage and is exhausted.

**Panaceas**: Wide-spectrum medicinal drugs that are specifically
designed not to interact harmfully. They can therefore be used on any
wound or illness and are guaranteed not to make things worse. A
character using panaceas may make a Medic check as if he had Medic 0
when treating an infection or disease.

**Stim Drugs**: Removes fatigue, at a cost. A character who uses stim
may remove the effects of fatigue but suffers one point of damage. If
stims are used to remove fatigue again without an intervening period of
sleep, the character suffers two points of damage the second time, three
points the third time, and so on.

## Explosives

The Demolitions skill is used with explosives – the Effect of the
Demolitions skill check multiplies the damage, with a minimum of x1
damage for an Effect of 0 or 1. Explosives are not legally available on
any world with a Law Level of 1 or greater.

#### Table: Explosives

| Weapon      | TL  | Damage   | Radius      | Cost (Cr) |
|-------------|-----|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Plastic     | 6   | 3D6      | 2D6 meters  | 200       |
| Pocket Nuke | 12  | 2D6 x 20 | 15D6 meters | 20,000    |
| TDX         | 12  | 4D6      | 4D6 meters  | 1,000     |

**Plastic**: This generic, multi-purpose plastic explosive is a favorite
of military units, terrorists, demolition teams and adventurers across
known space.

**Pocket Nuke**: Hideously illegal on many worlds, the pocket nuke is
actually the size of a briefcase and so is too large to fit into a
grenade launcher.

**TDX**: An advanced gravity-polarized explosive, TDX explodes only
along the horizontal axis.

## Personal Devices

Characters often possess any of a number of personal devices, such as
those described in this section.

#### Table: Personal Devices

| Description            | TL  | Cost     | Wgt |
|------------------------|-----|----------|-----|
| Magnetic Compass       | 3   | ₢10      | --  |

| Metal Detector         | 6   | ₢300     | 1   |
| Hand Calculator        | 7   | ₢10      | 0.1 |
| Inertial Locator       | 9   | ₢1,200   | 1.5 |
| Electromagnetic Probe  | 10  | ₢1,000   | --  |
| Hand Computer          | 11  | ₢1,000   | 0.5 |
| Holographic Projector  | 11  | ₢1,000   | 1   |
| Densitometer           | 14  | ₢20,000  | 5   |
| Bioscanner             | 15  | ₢350,000 | 3.5 |
| Neural Activity Sensor | 15  | ₢35,000  | 10  |

**Bioscanner**: The bioscanner 'sniffs' for organic molecules and tests
chemical samples, analysing the make-up of whatever it is focussed on.
It can be used to detect poisons or bacteria, analyse organic matter,
search for life signs and classify unfamiliar organisms. The data from a
bioscanner can be interpreted using the Comms or the Life Sciences
skill.

**Densitometer**: The remote densitometer uses an object’s natural
gravity to measure its density, building up a three-dimensional image of
the inside and outside of an object.

**Electromagnetic Probe**: This handy device detects the electromagnetic
emissions of technological devices, and can be used as a diagnostic tool
when examining equipment (+1 DM to work out what’s wrong with it) or
when searching for hidden bugs or devices. The Comms skill can be used
to sweep a room for bugs.

**Hand Calculator**: Allows the user to perform mathematical
calculations quickly.

**Hand Computer**: The ‘handcomp' provides services of a small computer,
plus serves as a computer terminal when linked (by its integral radio,
network interface jack, or by other circuit) to a standard computer.

**Holographic Projector**: A holographic projector is a toaster-sized
box that, when activated, creates a three-dimensional image in the space
around it or nearby – the range is approximately three meters in all
directions. The image can be given pre-programmed animations within a
limited range and the projector includes speakers for making sound. The
projected holograms are obviously not real so this device is mostly used
for communication. The TL 12 version can produce holograms real enough
to fool anyone who fails an Intelligence check (made upon first seeing
the hologram), at double the cost, and the TL 13 version can produce
holograms that are true-to-life images, at ten times the cost.

**Inertial Locator**: Indicates direction and distance traveled from the
starting location.

**Magnetic Compass**: Indicates direction of magnetic north, if any
exists.

**Metal Detector**: Indicates presence of metal within a 3 meter radius
(including underground), with the indicating signal growing stronger as
it gets closer to the source.

**Neural Activity Sensor (NAS)**: This device consists of a backpack and
detachable handheld unit, and can detect neural activity up to 500
meters away. The device can also give a rough estimation of the
intelligence level of organisms based on brainwave patterns. The data
from a neural activity scanner can be interpreted using the Comms, the
Life Sciences or the Social Sciences skills.

**Radiation Counter**: Indicates presence and intensity of radioactivity
within a 30-meter radius. The indicating signal will grow stronger as it
gets closer to the source.

**Wrist Watch**: Allows the user to tell time. At teck level 9, can be
configured to multiple worlds, as well as standard time, and allows the
user to configure alarms based on specific times.

## Robots and Drones

Robots are iconic to science fiction. This section describes the robots
and drones commonly available in a Märchen Engine campaign. A robot has
an Intellect program running, allowing it to make decisions
independently, while drones are remote-controlled by a character with
the Comms skill.

Robots and drones operate in combat like characters but take damage as
if they were vehicles. They have Hull and Structure characteristics
instead of an Endurance characteristic, and an Endurance DM of 0. Any
robot running an Intellect program has an Intelligence and Education
score. Drones have neither. A robot’s Education characteristic is
representative of the information programmed into it and even low-end
robots can have high Education scores. Most robots have Social Standing
characteristics of 0 as they are not social creations but there are some
exceptions, usually high-end models running advanced Intellect programs.
Drones do not have Social Standing but in cases where they are used to
engage in diplomacy or other social intercourse the operator can use his
own Social Standing score.

**Cargo Robot** (TL 11): These simple, heavy-duty robots are found in
starport docks and on board cargo ships. Cargo drones can be constructed
as low as Technology Level 9 but their utility is extremely limited
until the invention of Intellect programs.

**Combat Drone** (TL 12): Combat drones are little more than flying guns
mated to a grav floater and a computer system. The drones must be
piloted with the Remote Operations skill but attacks are made using the
appropriate weapon skill. Combat drones loaded with Intellect and combat
Expert programs (making them autonomous combat robots) are illegal on
many worlds.

> **Price**: ₢120,000

### Robot and Drone Options

**Armor**: Armor can be increased by 5, which increases the drone or
robot’s cost by 25%.

**Integral System**: Certain devices can be built into drones or robots
by increasing the cost of the device by +50%. Popular choices include
toolkits of different kinds, various sensors, or mobility upgrades like
thruster packs or grav floaters.

**Integral Weapon**: Any suitable weapon can be added to a drone or
robot, at the cost of ₢10,000 + the cost of the weapon.

## Sensory Aids

The following aids provide enhance a character’s physical senses.

#### Table: Sensory Aids

| Description               | TL  | Cost | Wgt  |
|---------------------------|-----|------|------|

| Light Intensifier Goggles | 7   | ₢500 | --   |

**Binoculars**: Allows the user to see further. At TL 8 electronic
enhancement allows images to be captured; light-intensification allows
them to be used in the dark. ₢750. At TL 12 PRIS (Portable Radiation
Imaging System) allows the user to observe a large section of the
EM-spectrum, from infrared to gamma rays. ₢3,500.

**Cold Light Lantern**: A fuel cell powered version of the electric
torch, but will last 3 days with continuous use. Produces a wide cone of
light up to 18 meters away with a radius of 6 meters at the end of the
beam. Also capable of producing a tight beam of light up to 36 meters
away with a 1 meter radius or be used to illuminate a 10 meter radius.

**Electric Torch**: The common flashlight. It is battery powered and
will last for about 6 hours of continuous use. A torch produces a wide
cone of light up to 18 meters long with a radius of 6 meters at the end
of the beam. Later TL models have adjustable beams allowing them to also
produce a tight beam of light up to 36 meters long, with a 1 meter
radius, or be used to illuminate a circle of 10 meter radius.

**Infrared Goggles**: Permits the user to see exothermic (heat-emitting)
sources in the dark.

**Light Intensifier Goggles**: Permits the user to see normally in
anything less than total darkness by electronically intensifying any
available light.

**Oil Lamp**: A lamp clearly illuminates a 4.5 meter radius, provides
shadowy illumination out to a 9 meter radius, and burns for 6 hours on a
pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand.

**Torch**: A torch burns for 1 hour, clearly illuminating a 6 meter
radius and providing shadowy illumination out to a 12 meter radius.

## Shelters

Whenever characters are not indulging in the creature comforts of
civilization, they need shelter, such as the items described in this
section.

#### Table: Shelters

| Description                 | TL  | Cost    | Wgt   |
|-----------------------------|-----|---------|-------|
| Tarpaulin                   | 1   | ₢10     | 2     |
| Tent                        | 2   | ₢200    | 3     |

**Advanced Base**: Modular pressurized quarters for 6 persons and
capable of withstanding anything less than hurricane force winds. Offers
excellent shelter from precipitation and all but the most extreme of
temperature ranges. Requires 12 man-hours to erect or dismantle. There
are 16 modules, each, 1.5m wide by 1.5m long by 2m high that can be
organized into any layout required. Dismantled and ready for shipment,
the advanced base weighs 6 tons. The cost includes life-support for six
people for 7 days.

**Basic Life Support Supplies**: Basic life support supplies (waste
reclamation chemicals, oxygen supply, CO2 scrubbers, etc.) necessary to
support one person for one day in an enclosed, pressurized environment,
such as a pressure tent or an advanced base.

**Pre-Fabricated Cabin**: Modular unpressurized quarters for 6 persons
and capable of withstanding light to severe winds. Offers excellent
shelter from precipitation, storms, and temperatures down to -10º
Celsius. Requires 8 man-hours to erect or dismantle. There are 16
modules, each, 1.5m wide by 1.5m long by 2m high that can be organized
into any layout required. Dismantled and ready for shipment, the cabin
weighs 4 tons.

**Pressure Tent**: Basic pressurized shelter for two persons, providing
standard atmosphere and conditions, along with protection from
precipitation, storms, and up to strong winds. There is no airlock: the
tent must be depressurized to enter or leave it.

**Tarpaulin**: A heavy hard-wearing waterproof fabric made of canvas or
similar, for outdoor use as a temporary shelter or protective covering
against moisture. Measures 4 meters long by 2 meters wide.

**Tent**: Basic shelter for two persons offering protection from
precipitation, storms, and temperatures down to 0º Celsius, and
withstanding light to moderate winds. Larger, more elaborate tents
capable of sheltering more people, higher winds or colder temperatures
weigh and cost more.

## Survival Equipment

Survival equipment helps the character stay physically alive and able to
take action, even in the most unusual of environments.

| Portable Generator    | 10  | ₢500,000 | 15  |

**Artificial Gill**: Extracts oxygen from water to allowing the wearer
to breathe for an unlimited time while submerged under water. Functions
only on worlds with thin, standard, or dense (type 4 through 9)
atmospheres.

**Cold Weather Clothing**: Protects against frigid weather (-20º Celsius
or below). Adds a DM+2 to all Endurance checks made to resist the
effects of cold weather exposure. Reduce the weight by 1kg for every 5
TL.

**Combination Mask**: A combination of both filter mask and respirator,
which allows breathing of very thin, tainted atmospheres (type 2), plus
all atmospheres listed under filter and respirator masks.

**Environment Suit**: Designed to protect the wearer from extreme cold
or heat, the environment suit has a hood, gloves and boots but leaves
the face exposed in normal operations.

**Filter Mask**: A filter set that allows an individual to breathe
tainted atmospheres (types 4, 7, and 9). Also protects against the
inhalation of heavy smoke or dust.

**Oxygen Tanks**: A complete set of compressed oxygen tanks, which allow
independent breathing in smoke, dust, gas, or exotic (type A)
atmosphere. Two tanks last 6 hours. Refill of proper atmospheric mixture
for race cost ₢20.

**Portable Generator**: This is a heavy-duty portable fusion generator,
capable of recharging weapons and other equipment for up to one month of
use.

**Rescue Bubble**: A large (2m diameter) pressurized plastic bubble.
Piezoelectric layers in the bubble wall translate the user's movements
into electricity to recharge the bubble's batteries and power its
distress beacon, and a small oxygen tank both inflates the bubble and
provides two person/hours of life support. A self-repairing plastic seal
serves as an emergency airlock. Rescue bubbles are found on both space
vessels and water craft as emergency lifeboats.

**Respirator**: A small compressor that allows an individual to breathe
in very thin atmospheres (type 3).

**Swimming Equipment**: Includes swim fins, wet suit, face mask.
Protects against the effects of cold (5º Celsius or below), along with
improving speed and maneuverability underwater; add DM +1 to all
Athletics skill checks in these situations when wearing proper swimming
equipment.

**Thruster Pack**: A simple thruster pack gives the user the ability to
maneuver in zero-gravity. A Zero-G check is required to use a thruster
pack accurately. Thruster packs can only be used in microgravity
environments and are only practical for journeys between spacecraft at
Adjacent range.

**Underwater Air Tanks**: Equivalent to oxygen tanks but designed for
use underwater. Two tanks last 6 hours. Refill of proper atmospheric
mixture for race and expected depth cost ₢20.

**AFV**: A heavily armored ATV, known as an Armored Fighting Vehicle,
equipped with a triple laser turret. The lasers use the Energy Rifle
skill, do 4D6 damage each using the Ranged (rifle) range modifiers, and
one, two or three may be fired at the same target with one attack
action.

**Air/Raft**: An open-topped vehicle supported by anti-gravity
technology. Air/rafts can even reach orbit (taking a number of hours
equal to the world’s Size code) but passengers at that altitude must
wear vacc suits. They are ubiquitous, remarkably reliable and flexible
vehicles.

**ATV**: An enclosed, pressurized all-terrain ground vehicle. The
vehicle is capable of floating on calm water, and has a suite of
built-in sensors and communications equipment (usually a laser
transceiver) making it ideal for exploration. An ATV has a hardpoint for
a turret, but does not come with a weapon normally.

**Biplane Aircraft**: A primitive form of aircraft with two pairs of
wings, one above the other. This vehicle can only transport 100kg of
cargo.

**Destroyer** A fast maneuverable long-endurance watercraft built for
military action, intended to escort larger watercraft in a fleet, convoy
or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful short-range
attackers. Powered by a fusion power plant, the destroyer carries
deck-mounted turrets capable of firing major. Cargo capacity is limited
to 40 tons, mostly used to carry ammunition.

**G/Carrier**: A grav carrier is effectively a flying tank, and is the
standard fighting vehicle of many military forces. The turret-mounted
fusion gun is a vehicle-mounted version of the TL 15 FGMP and uses the
same ‘serious firepower’ rules. Advanced containment systems mean that
it does not leak radiation with each shot in the same way as the
man-portable version. Like the air/raft, the G/Carrier can reach orbit
(taking a number of hours equal to the world’s Size code).

**Grav Belt**: A grav belt resembles a parachute harness, and is fitted
with artificial gravity modules allowing the wearer to fly. The internal
battery can operate for a maximum of four hours before needing to be
recharged. At TL 15, the battery can operate for 12 hours before
charging. Options cannot be added to the grav belt.

**Grav Floater**: A grav floater is a forerunner of the grav belt, a
platform upon which a single person can stand and be carried along. It
cannot achieve any great speed but can, like an air/raft, achieve any
altitude up to orbit (taking a number of hours equal to the world’s Size
code).

**Ground Car**: A ground car is a conventional wheeled automobile.

**Helicopter**: An aircraft that derives both lift and propulsion from
one or more sets of horizontally revolving overhead rotors. It is
capable of moving vertically and horizontally, the direction of motion
being controlled by the pitch of the rotor blades. The helicopter can
carry 500 kg of cargo.

**Hovercraft**: A vehicle that travels over land or water on a cushion
of air provided by a downward blast, the hovercraft is only usable on
words with a Thin atmosphere or thicker. The hovercraft has 3 tons of
cargo space.

**Motor Boat**: Watercraft using hydrofoils to achieve exceptional speed
and performance. The hold of the vehicle can accommodate 10 tons of
cargo.

**Small Steamship**: A watercraft that is propelled by a steam engine.
The steamship has a cargo capacity of 50 tons.

**Speeder**: Capable of high speed transit across a planetary surface,
the speeder is a streamlined grav vehicle with a limited cargo capacity
of 100kg. This vehicle only takes an hour to reach orbit.

**Submersible**: A watercraft designed to operate under an ocean’s
surface. Submersibles are often used as transport between domed cities
on waterworlds and other planets with large fluid oceans. The
submersible can carry 30 tons of cargo.

**Twin Jet Aircraft**: A fixed-wing aircraft propelled by jet engines,
often used to transport cargo. The hold has a cargo capacity of 5 tons.

### Vehicle Options

With the exception of on-board computer, each of these options can only
be taken once on a given vehicle.

**Autopilot** (TL 11): An autopilot has a Model 1 computer specialized
to run Intellect/1 and an Expert/1 in an appropriate skill and
specialty. This will be in addition to any other computers installed. An
autopilot is often mandatory on cheaper commercial models. In many areas
(primarily urban) they are required to be in use. Higher Law Level
polities may require a slave modification to the autopilot for
centralized and/or emergency traffic control. ₢3,000.

**Enclosed**: This modification turns an open vehicle into a closed one.
It costs 10% of the base cost of the vehicle, reduces Agility by 1 and
top speed by 10%.

**Extended Life Support**: A vehicle which is sealed can be equipped for
extended life support, which increases the duration to 18 hours per
person. Costs another 10% of the base cost of the vehicle.

**Heavy Armor**: Increasing the armor of a vehicle by 5 adds 25% to the
cost of the vehicle.

**High Performance**: A vehicle can be made into a high-performance
vehicle, increasing its top speed by 20%. The vehicle costs 50% more.

**On-board Computer**: Adding an on-board computer costs the same as a
hand computer.

**Sealed**: This option can be added to any closed vehicle (it is
included in the ATV, AFV, G/Carrier and Speeder). The vehicle can be
sealed and provides life support for its passengers and crew for two
hours per person. This option adds 20% to the cost of the vehicle.

**Style**: Allows a vehicle to be customized to the buyer’s wishes.
Costs ₢200 to ₢2,000.

## Weapons

**Bayonet**: A small knife-like weapon similar to a dagger, frequently
attached to a rifle. When not attached to a rifle, the bayonet performs
as a dagger.

**Blade**: A hybrid knife weapon with a heavy, flat two-edged blade
nearly 300mm in length, and (often, but not always) a semi-basket
handguard. Because of the bulk of the handguard, it is generally carried
in a belt scabbard. Blades are as much survival tools as weapons, and
are often found in emergency kits, lifeboats etc.

**Broadsword**: The largest of the sword weapons, also called the
two-handed sword because it requires both hands to swing. The blade is
extremely heavy, two-edged, and about 1000 to 1200mm in length. The hilt
is relatively simple, generally a cross-piece only, with little
basketwork or protection. When carried, the broadsword is worn in a
metal scabbard attached to the belt; less frequently, the scabbard is
worn on the back, and the broadsword is drawn over the shoulder.

**Cudgel**: A basic stick used as a weapon. Easily obtained from
standing trees or through the use of an unloaded long gun such as a
rifle or carbine (laser weapons are too delicate to be used as cudgels).
Length: 1000 to 2000mm.

**Cutlass**: A heavy, flat-bladed, single-edged weapon featuring a full
basket hilt to protect the hand. The cutlass is the standard shipboard
blade weapon and sometimes kept in lockers on the bulkhead near
important locations; when worn, a belt scabbard is used. Blade length
varies from 600 to 900mm.

**Dagger**: A small knife weapon with a flat, two-edged blade
approximately 200mm in length. Daggers are usually carried in a belt
sheath, or less frequently concealed in a boot sheath or strapped to the
forearm. Daggers are usually as much a tool as a last-resort weapon of
defense, and worn constantly. Each weighs 250 grams; that weight,
however, does not count against the weight load of the character as the
weapon is worn constantly and comfortably.

**Foil**: Also known as the rapier, this weapon is a light, sword-like
weapon with a pointed, edged blade 800mm in length, and a basket or cup
hilt to protect the hand. Foils are worn in scabbards attached to the
belt.

**Halberd**: A two-handed pole weapon having an axe-like blade and a
steel spike mounted on the end of a long shaft. Length: 2500mm.

**Pike**: A two-handed weapon with a pointed steel or iron head on a
long wooden shaft. Length: 3000 to 4000mm.

**Spear**: A weapon with a long shaft and a pointed tip, typically of
metal, used for thrusting or throwing. Length: 3000mm.

**Sword**: The standard long-edged weapon, featuring a flat, two-edged
blade. It may or may not have a basket hilt or hand protector. A
scabbard to carry the sword may be attached to the belt, or to straps
(or a sash) over the shoulder. Blade length may vary from 700 to 950mm.

### Ranged Weapons

**Accelerator Rifle**: Designed specifically for zero-g combat, the
accelerator rifle fires a specially designed round which upon leaving
the barrel is accelerated by a secondary propelling charge. Normally the
rifle fires bursts of three rounds per pull of the trigger, but may be
adjusted to fire single rounds.

**Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR)**: A progressive development of the
assault rifle.

**Assault Rifle**: A lighter and less expensive version of the automatic
rifle.

**Automatic Rifle**: A highly refined and tuned version of the rifle,
capable of full automatic fire as well as semi-automatic shots.
Normally, the automatic rifle fires bursts of four bullets for each pull
of the trigger. It may be switched to semi-automatic fire at the end of
a combat round, after all firing, in which case it is treated as a rifle
until switched back to burst mode. Ammunition and magazines are
identical to those used for the rifle.

**Auto Pistol**: Also referred to as a Semi-Automatic Pistol, Automatic
Pistol or just a Pistol, the auto pistol is a basic repeating handgun.
One cartridge is fired for each pull of the trigger. Auto pistol
ammunition is interchangeable with submachinegun ammunition (although
magazines are not). Preloaded magazines may be inserted into an empty
pistol, but require a reload action to complete.

**Body Pistol**: A small, non-metallic semiautomatic pistol designed to
evade detection by most weapon detectors. One cartridge is fired for
each pull of the trigger. Pre-loaded magazines may be inserted into the
pistol when it is empty, requiring a reload action to do so. Body pistol
ammunition is not interchangeable with the ammunition for any other
types of guns.

**Bow**: A stout but supple piece of wood carved to a specific shape and
strung with a piece of cord, string or gut to increase tension. The
string is pulled back and released to hurl an arrow long distances with
surprising force. At higher technology levels, bows are modified with
additional strings and pulley systems to add accuracy and power.

**Carbine**: A short type of rifle firing a small caliber round. A
magazine containing ten rounds is inserted into the underside of the
carbine ahead of the trigger guard or behind the handgrip (this
configuration is referred to as “Bullpup”, and in some localities
carbines may be referred to as Bullpups), and one round is fired with
each pull of the trigger. Replacement of an empty magazine takes a
reload action. Carbine ammunition is not interchangeable with any other
type of ammunition. In essence, a carbine is a short rifle, firing a
cartridge of smaller, lighter caliber. A sling usually allows the
carbine to be carried on the shoulder, out of the way.

**Crossbow**: A horizontal bow set into a mechanical firing mechanism
and stronger-than-normal pull, crossbows are very powerful weapons that
are very time consuming to reload. At higher technology levels,
crossbows are built with crank and pulley systems that make the weapons
easier to reload, even self-loading at TL9. Reloading a TL2 crossbow
takes 6 minor actions, at TL4 this is reduced to 3 minor actions.

**Gauss Rifle**: The ultimate development of the slug thrower, the gauss
rifle generates an electromagnetic field along the length of the barrel
which accelerates a bullet to high velocities. The round itself consists
of a dense armor piercing core surrounded by a softer metal covering,
ending in a hollow point, giving the round excellent stopping power and
good armor penetration.

**Laser Carbine**: A lightweight version of the laser rifle, firing high
energy bolts using current from a backpack battery/power pack. The laser
carbine fires a 2mm beam of energy, aimed by integrated optic sights.
The power pack is capable of producing 50 shots before it requires
recharging. Recharging requires at least eight hours connected to a
high-energy source. The laser carbine is connected to the power pack by
a heavy-duty cable.

**Laser Pistol**: A pistol equivalent of the laser carbine, though still
dependent on an external power pack.

**Laser Rifle**: The standard high energy weapon, firing energy bolts in
the same manner as the laser carbine. Heavier, the laser rifle is also
capable of longer sustained action, and is somewhat sturdier. The power
pack can provide 100 shots before recharging. As in the laser carbine,
the laser rifle is connected to the power pack by a heavy-duty cable.
Power packs are not interchangeable between the two weapons, however.

**Revolver**: An early handgun, the revolver fires 9mm bullets with
characteristics similar to those used by the automatic pistol but not
interchangeable with them. No magazine is used: six cartridges are
inserted into the revolver individually. Reloading takes two combat
rounds, or one combat round if the individual foregoes the benefit of
evasion.

**Rifle**: The standard military arm, firing a 7mm, 10 gram bullet at a
velocity of approximately 900 meters per second. Longer and heavier than
a carbine, it is also more effective. Standard equipment includes
provisions for attaching a bayonet and telescopic sights, and a shoulder
sling. A twenty-round magazine is attached to the front of the trigger
guard, and one round is fired with each pull of the trigger. Replacement
of the empty magazine requires a reload action. Rifle ammunition may
also be used in automatic rifles; rifle and auto rifle magazines are
interchangeable, and weigh the same.

**Shotgun**: The basic weapon for maximum shock effect without regard to
accuracy. The shotgun has an 18mm diameter barrel and fires shells
containing either six 7mm bullets, or one hundred and thirty 3mm
pellets. In each case, the projectiles weigh a total of 30 grams.
Velocity for the projectiles is about 350 meters per second. A
cylindrical magazine containing 10 shells is inserted under the barrel
and parallel to it; cartridges are then fed automatically into the
shotgun for firing. Reloading consists of replacing the cylindrical
magazine and takes two combat rounds. One shot is fired for each pull of
the trigger. Magazines measure approximately 350mm long by 20mm in
diameter and are quite clumsy to carry. Shotguns are equipped with a
sling for carrying.

**Snub Pistol**: A low velocity revolver designed for use shipboard and
in zero-g environments.

**Submachinegun (SMG)**: A small automatic weapon designed to fire
pistol ammunition. Magazines holding 30 cartridges are inserted into the
weapon forward of the trigger guard or in the pistol grip, depending on
the design. The gun fires a burst of four rounds per pull of the
trigger. Replacement of an empty magazine requires one combat round.
Submachinegun ammunition (but not magazines) is interchangeable with
autopistol ammunition. Most submachineguns are equipped with slings for
ease of carrying. Some are small enough to be carried in a shoulder or
hip holster.

#### Ranged Weapon Options

The following options are generally available for certain ranged
weapons.

**Folding Stocks**: Carbines, rifles, and shotguns can be equipped with
folding stocks which make it possible to reduce the overall length of
the weapon by 300mm.

**Grenade Launcher**: An underslung RAM grenade launcher can be added to
any rifle. This grenade launcher has a magazine of one grenade, cannot
fire on automatic and takes four minor actions to reload.

**Gyrostabilizer**: Stabilizers can be added to any weapon with recoil,
reducing the recoil penalty by one point (to DM-1).

**Intelligent Weapon**: This adds a Model/ 0 computer to any weapon. The
TL 13 upgrade adds Model /1 to any weapon, for ₢5,000.

**Laser Sight**: Integrated optics and laser sights give an extra +1 DM
bonus to any attack that has been aimed. At TL 10, x-ray lasers and
improved display technology removes the tell-tale ‘red dot’ of a
vislight laser. ₢200.

**Laser Telescopic Sights**: Electronic sights combining the
capabilities of both electronic and telescopic sights. They are still
rather fragile.

**Secure Weapon**: A secure weapon requires authentication in some
fashion (scanning the user’s DNA or iris patterns, entering a password,
transmission of an unlocking code from a comm) before it can be fired.

**Shoulder Stocks**: It is possible to produce a shoulder stock which
may be attached temporarily to a pistol or revolver, resulting in a
crude carbine arrangement and some greater accuracy at longer ranges.
When firing a pistol or revolver equipped with such a stock, treat the
weapon as ranged (shotgun). The overall length of the pistol is
increased by the length of the stock, and the pistol cannot be
holstered. Attaching the stock (or detaching it) requires five combat
rounds.

**Silencer**: A silencer can be added to any slug thrower with ROF 4 or
less, masking the sound produced by firing. (–4 DM to detect.)

**Telescopic Sights**: High-quality telescopic sights for attachment to
weapons, for increasing their accuracy, especially at longer ranges. A
weapon equipped with such sights gains an extra +1 DM bonus to any
attack that has been aimed. Telescopic sights are delicate, however, and
may be jarred out of alignment by any violent action (such as being left
untended in a moving truck, a close explosion, or being dropped) on an
8+ on 2D6. When the sights go out of adjustment, the firer will always
miss.

### Grenades

A grenade is a small explosive device designed to be thrown by hand
(treat as Ranged (thrown) for Difficulty by range) or launched from a
grenade launcher (treat as Ranged (shotgun) for Difficulty by range). A
number of grenades are described in the Common Grenades table. Each
column is described as follows:

**Cost**: Price in Crowns (Cr) for a case of six grenades.

**TL**: The minimum tech level required to manufacture such an item.

**Wgt**: Weight per grenade in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).

**Damage**: The damage a weapon inflicts.

**LL**: The Law Level where the weapon first becomes illegal.

#### Table: Common Grenades

| Weapon  | TL  | Cost per Case | Wgt | Damage                       | LL  |
|---------|-----|---------------|-----|------------------------------|-----|
| Frag    | 6   | ₢180          | 0.5 | 5D6/3D6/1D6; see description | 1   |
| Smoke   | 6   | ₢90           | 0.5 | Special; see description     | 1   |
| Aerosol | 9   | ₢90           | 0.5 | Special; see description     | 1   |
| Stun    | 9   | ₢180          | 0.5 | 3D6 stun; see description    | 1   |

**Aerosol**: Aerosol grenades create a fine mist six meters in radius
that diffuses lasers but does not block normal vision. Any laser attack
made through the mist has its damage reduced by 10. Laser communications
through the mist are completely blocked. The mist dissipates in 1D6x3
rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce
this time.

**Frag**: The damage from fragmentation grenades decreases with distance
from the blast:

#### Table: Frag Grenade Damage by Distance

| Distance | Damage |
|----------|--------|
| 3 meters | 5D6    |
| 6 meters | 3D6    |
| 9 meters | 1D6    |

**Smoke**: Smoke grenades create a thick cloud of smoke six meters in
radius, centered on the location of the grenade. This smoke imposes a –2
DM on all attacks within or through the cloud (doubled for laser
weapons). Smoke dissipates in 1D6x3 rounds, although high winds and
other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time.

**Stun**: Stun weapons, such as stun grenades, are non-lethal and do not
inflict normal damage. A character within six meters of a stun grenade
detonation must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the
damage (after armor is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed
the character is knocked unconscious. If the Endurance check is
successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon and the stun
damage is ignored.

### Heavy Weapons

Heavy weapons are man-portable and larger weapons that cause extreme
property damage. Common Heavy Weapons table lists the heavy weapons
commonly available in a Märchen Engine campaign. Each column is
described as follows:

**Cost**: Price in Crowns (Cr) or 1000s of Crowns (KCr).

**TL**: The minimum tech level required to manufacture such an item.

**Wgt**: Weight in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).

**RoF**: Rate of Fire. The number of rounds that may be fired during a
significant action in the format: Single Shot / Auto

**Range**: The range category for this weapon.

**Damage**: The damage a weapon inflicts.

**Recoil**: Lists if the weapon has recoil when fired.

**LL**: The Law Level where the weapon first becomes illegal.

#### Heavy Weapons Ammunition

The Common Heavy Weapons Ammunition table describes the cost of
ammunitions and power packs for certain heavy weapons. Each column is
described as follows:

**Cost**: The cost of a full magazine of standard ammunition or power
pack for a weapon

**TL**: The minimum tech level required to manufacture such an item.

**Wgt**: The weight of a full magazine or power pack for a weapon.

**Rounds**: The number of rounds the weapon may fire before it must be
reloaded or recharged.

#### Table: Common Heavy Weapons

| Weapon               | TL  | Cost     | Wgt | RoF | Range                   | Damage     | Recoil | LL  |
|----------------------|-----|----------|-----|-----|-------------------------|------------|--------|-----|
| Grenade Launcher     | 7   | ₢400     | 6   | 1   | ranged (shotgun)        | By grenade | Yes    | 3   |
| Rocket Launcher      | 7   | ₢2,000   | 6   | 1   | ranged (rocket)         | 4D6        | No     | 3   |
| RAM Grenade Launcher | 8   | ₢800     | 6   | 1/3 | ranged (assault weapon) | By grenade | Yes    | 3   |
| PGMP                 | 12  | ₢20,000  | 10  | 1/4 | ranged (rifle)          | 10D6       | Yes    | 2   |
| FGMP                 | 14  | ₢100,000 | 12  | 1/4 | ranged (rifle)          | 16D6       | Yes    | 2   |

#### Table: Common Heavy Weapon Ammunition

| Weapon               | TL  | Cost    | Wgt | Rounds |
|----------------------|-----|---------|-----|--------|
| Grenade Launcher     | 7   | ₢180    | 0.5 | 6      |
| Rocket Launcher      | 7   | ₢300    | 1   | 1      |
| RAM Grenade Launcher | 8   | ₢180    | 0.5 | 6      |
| PGMP                 | 12  | ₢2,500  | 6   | 40     |
| FGMP                 | 14  | ₢65,000 | 9   | 40     |

**FGMP (Fusion Gun, Man-Portable)**: It includes a gravity suspension
system to reduce its inertia, making it easier to use than the PGMP
(minimum Strength 9) and fires what amounts to a directed nuclear
explosion. Those without radiation protection who are nearby when a FGMP
is fired will suffer a lethal dose of radiation – each firing of an FGMP
emits 2D6 x 20 rads, which will affect everyone within the immediate
vicinity.

**Grenade Launcher**: Grenade launchers are used to fire grenades over
long distances. Grenades for a grenade launcher are not interchangeable
with handheld grenades.

**PGMP (Plasma Gun, Man-Portable)**: It is so heavy and bulky that it
can only be used easily by a trooper with a Strength of 12 or more –
usually attained by wearing battle dress. Every point by which a user’s
Strength falls short is a –1 DM on any attack rolls made with it.

**RAM Grenade Launcher**: Rocket Assisted Multi-purpose grenade
launchers have a longer range and are capable of firing up to three
grenades with a single attack. This uses the rules for firing on full
auto; unlike other automatic weapons, a RAM grenade launcher cannot fire
in burst mode. It takes two minor actions to reload a RAM grenade
launcher. Grenades for a RAM grenade launcher are not interchangeable
with handheld grenades.

**Rocket Launcher**: To counteract the recoil of the weapon, a rocket
launcher channels exhaust backwards in an explosive back blast. Anyone
up to 1.5 meters behind a rocket launcher when it fires takes 3D6 damage
from the burning gasses. Vehicle-mounted rocket launchers lose this
side-effect as a vehicle is a more stable firing platform than a person.
It takes three minor actions to reload a rocket launcher.

The rockets presented are high-explosive models. Do not add the Effect
of the attack roll to their damage but apply that damage to everything
within six meters of the impact point. A rocket that misses has a 50%
chance (4+ on 1D6) of detonating upon impact with the ground (6 – Effect
meters away in a random direction). Otherwise it will miss completely
and leave the battlefield without striking anything or detonating.

## CHAPTER 5.5 LOW TECH EQUIPMENT

This chapter describes common tools, weapons, and other items used by
adventurers, sorcerers, barbarians, and plucky Earthlings trapped
underneath alien skies.

Assume that characters begin play with clothes suitable for adventuring.
Other equipment comes from mustering out benefits or may be purchased
from the character's gold (such as the gold received on the Gold
mustering out tables).

#### A Note on Tech Levels

The Märchen Engine rules, uses "Tech Levels" to describe the wide
spectrum of technology from the Stone Age to the stars. The core Märchen
Engine book has a much narrower technological spectrum, and thus it does
not list tech levels for its equipment. Unless otherwise noted, all
equipment in this book is either TL0 or TL1 in Cepheus Light terms. The
worlds this game describes are, for the most part, TL1 worlds. Future
supplements may add more advanced technology, from gunpowder and robots
to lasers. Stay tuned for further releases from Stellagama Publishing!

In certain Märchen Engine settings one can find both iron—and thus
steel—and bronze items. All of these are TL1 in Cepheus Light terms.
However, bronze weapons suffer DM-1 to hit, and metal armor made of
bronze has one point less armor than the same item made of iron or
steel.

### Gold, Silver, and Other Coins

Historically speaking, there were many types of coins, at various values
and exchange rates. However, for ease of play, trade and shopping in
Märchen Engine uses Credits(₢). However many role playing games use the
well-known "fantasy coinage" system of gold pieces (₢) and silver pieces
(sp). This allows compatibility with many other games and adventures,
which use similar coinage. The Märchen Engine equates 1 credit(₢) equal
to 1 gold piece. A gold piece is very valuable and equals ten silver
pieces. A single gold piece can keep a peasant family alive for a month
at subsistence level. Beginning adventurers can live reasonably
comfortably from several dozen gold pieces a month – paying for
accommodations and food at inns rather than living on their own land.

#### Rarer Coins

Various traditional fantasy and sword & sorcery books provide treasure
in a wider variety of coins than the simple gold and silver of Märchen
Engine. Use the following table to convert these kinds of coins to
silver and gold.

| **Coin**      |             |             | **Exchange Value** |          |               |

### Encumbrance

*Märchen Engine* avoids any encumbrance mechanics that entail the
careful accounting of a character’s equipment weight. Instead, a
character may carry a number of major “items” equal to their STR with no
penalty. This represents a Light Load. Characters may carry items beyond
this: up to three times their STR, which constitutes a Heavy Load. A
heavily loaded character suffers DM-1 to all physical task throws and
can only use a maximum of one move action in a combat round.

An “item” is anything of significant size: a sword, a 3-meter pole, a
standard length of rope. Larger items may count as more than one item,
and we note them as such in their description. Small items, such as a
compass, a needle, or a candle, do not count as items, subject to the
Referee’s judgment.

### Living Expenses

In an adventure deep in the wilderness, characters sleep under the
stars, or under small shelters. They live off rations and from hunting
and gathering food. In civilization, however, they will often have to
purchase their accommodations and food. The following table provides
costs of living. One column covers the monthly cost of living – which
assumes a long-term purchase of lodging and groceries. The second
indicates daily cost of living, when adventurers are lodging and eating
at inns or similar establishments.

| **Quality of Living**  | **Monthly Cost** | **Daily Cost** | **Common Professions**                   |
|------------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Wretched (SOC 0-1)     | ₢1               | ₢0.1           | Poor peasants                            |
| Poor (SOC 2-3)         | ₢12              | ₢0.5           | Average peasants                         |
| Adequate (SOC 4-5)     | ₢25              | ₢2             | Skilled laborers and journeyman crafters |
| Comfortable (SOC 6-8)  | ₢75              | ₢10            | Master crafters and yeoman farmers       |
| Prosperous (SOC 9-10)  | ₢300             | ₢25            | Master professional and knights          |
| Opulent (SOC B-C)      | ₢1,000           | ₢50            | Aristocrats                              |
| Aristocratic (SOC D-E) | ₢6,000           | ₢400           | Landed nobility                          |
| Royal (SOC F-G)        | ₢12,000          | ₢1000          | Worthy of a prince!                      |

The SOC ratings are approximate levels of comfort enjoyed by characters
of such standing, and are not binding to a certain level of SOC. The
Referee may decide to grant bonuses to living at a much higher standard
of living than your SOC indicates or penalties for living at a much
lower quality of life than your SOC demands.

### Adventuring Equipment

**Equipment Notes:**

**Backpack:** a backpack allows a person to carry items while keeping
the hands free. The backpack itself does not count as an item for the
sake of encumbrance and may carry up to 4 items (which still count
against the character's encumbrance limit).

**Candles:** a candle will illuminate a radius of approximately 1.5m and
burns for an hour.

**Dogs:** hunting dogs are fast, lean hounds used to track and bring
down prey, typically working in a pack. War dogs are massive mastiffs,
trained to be loyal to their masters and kill on command. A well-bred,
well-trained war dog is fiercer than most human soldiers!

**Flint and steel:** used to start fires with ease. Lighting a fire with
flint and steel takes 1 combat round (6 seconds). Lighting a fire
without flint and steel takes 1 exploration turn (10 minutes) and
requires a Survival 4+ throw.

**Grappling hook:** a large iron hook used for anchoring a rope.
Grappling a distant target with a grappling hook requires an Athletics
8+ throw.

**Hammer (small):** may serve for work or for driving iron or wooden
spikes. If used in combat, it causes 1D damage.

**Healer's Kit:** a well-packed collection of herbs, bandages, needles,
scalpels, and other items used to treat injuries, disease, and poison.

**Holy symbol:** a symbol holy to a religion, often worn as a necklace.
At the Referee's discretion, this may grant DM+1 to Religion throws
against magic and magical creatures.

**Ink:** a small bottle of black ink. Other colors cost twice as much.

**Iron spikes:** metal pitons used to secure ropes, or to spike doors
open or shut.

**Lantern:** a covered oil lamp. It burns 1 flask of common oil per 4
hours and illuminates up to a 10m radius. May be closed to conceal its
flame or protect the fire from wind or rain.

**Mirror:** a small, handheld polished steel mirror. May serve to peek
around corner without risking bodily damage from concealed threats.

**Musical instrument:** any one of many musical instruments. Costs range
from 25₢ for a simple instrument; a good-quality instrument will cost
around 50₢; superior designs can go for 100₢ or more.

**Oil:** common oil is used as fuel in lamps or is a food ingredient.
Military oil is highly flammable and adhesive. Accurately throwing a
flask of lit military oil (often with a cloth fuse) at enemies requires
a DEX 8+ throw, has an effective range equal to the thrower's STR and a
maximum range equal to twice the thrower's STR. A failed throw means
that the flask deviates 1D meters in a random direction from the
intended point of impact. It has the Fire weapon Aspect (see below) and
a Blast 1.5 Aspect.

**Padlock:** a common iron lock with a key.

**Pole, 3.048m:** a 5cm-thick, 3.048m-long wooden shaft. Older,
experienced adventurers use it to test the depth of ponds and poke at
suspected traps.

**Pouch:** a small leather or cloth bag capable of holding one item.

**Rations:** dried, salted, or otherwise preserved food. Rations will
last for up to 2 months in the wilderness before spoiling. At the
Referee's discretion, they may spoil earlier in bad environments, such
as noxious swamps or damp underground caverns.

**Rope, 20m:** a strong rope capable of supporting up to 300kg –
approximately three average adventurers with typical gear.

**Sack:** this cloth or leather bag may hold up to 6 items.

**Spell Codes, blank:** a high-quality parchment or paper book, used for
recording spells as described in the Sorcery chapter.

**Stakes and mallet:** 30cm-long sharpened wooden shafts made famous by
horror tales about vampires. The mallet is wooden or metal.

**Thief's tools:** a set of lockpicks and other small tools used for
burglary and to tamper with various mechanisms. Using them will often
require a Craft throw.

**Torch:** wooden shafts tipped with pitch and cloth. A torch burns for
1 hour and clearly illuminates a 10m radius.

**Waterskin/Wineskin:** a container – usually made from leather –
capable of holding 1 liter of liquid.

### Personal Armor

Personal armor reduces the damage caused by incoming attacks. Subtract
the armor’s Protection rating from any damage caused to the character.
Note that heavier armor counts as several items for calculating
encumbrance.

| **Armor**    | **Protection** | **Cost** | **Encumbrance** |
|--------------|----------------|----------|-----------------|
| Hide and fur | 3              | ₢10      | 1 item          |
| Leather      | 4              | ₢20      | 1 item          |
| Scale        | 5              | ₢30      | 1 item          |
| Chain        | 6              | ₢40      | 2 items         |
| Banded       | 8              | ₢50      | 3 items         |
| Plate        | 10             | ₢60      | 3 items         |

**Hide and Fur:** crude armor made from animal skin. Provides good
protection from the cold but minimal protection from any but the crudest
weapon.

**Leather:** armor made from hardened leather or laminated linen.

**Scale:** armor consisting of many small metal, leather, or horn scales
attached to a backing material such as cloth or leather.

**Chain:** armor made from small metal rings linked together in a
pattern to form a mesh. Provides superior protection to the various hide
and leather-based armors, but less than that of heavier metal armors.
This is a highly common type of armor among soldiers.

**Banded:** armor made of overlapping horizontal stripes of laminated
metal attached to leather backing. Heavy but provides significant
protection.

**Plate:** armor made from large, overlapping metal plates worn over the
chest and vital areas. Plate armor includes chain armor parts covering
the joints and other less-protected body parts.

#### Armor, Noise, and Swimming

Heavy armor – scale armor or heavier – is cumbersome and noisy when
worn. Using such armor subjects its wearer to DM-2 to all throws related
to stealth, swimming, balancing on a tight rope, or any other situation
where wearing a heavy suit of metal armor might be detrimental to the
effort. When wearing banded armor, this penalty increases to DM-3, plate
armor wearers suffer a DM-4 penalty.

### Vehicles and Mounts

The following are typical vehicles, both land and maritime, used in
antiquity-inspired and medieval-inspired worlds. This also includes
mounts, such as horses and giant lizards. Appendix B provides various
science-fantasy vehicles such as skyships and flying saucers.

#### Stat Block Explanation

**Cost:** in Credits (₢)

**Agi:** Agility, representing the vehicle’s maneuverability. Applies as
DM to skill throws in vehicle combat.

**Spd:** speed in kilometers per day.

**Light Damage Threshold:** Weapons must throw this number or above on
their AV dice to penetrate armor and cause regular damage hits.

**Critical Damage Threshold:** Weapons must throw this number or above
on their AV dice to cause a critical damage hit. Note that melee
weapons, bows, and crossbows never cause critical damage.

Living mounts, do not have damage thresholds. They fight like any other
animal (see the Combat and Monsters chapters).

**Weapons:** how many artillery weapons a vehicle may carry (if any).
Note that a heavy catapult counts as two such weapons.

**Crew:** the number of crewmembers the vehicle requires to operate.

**Cargo:** cargo capacity in kilograms or tons. A boat or ship may carry
one passenger with typical supplies instead of 100kg of cargo (10
passengers per ton).

\* Animal; use standard animal movement rules.

**Boat, river:** a 10m long boat with a beam (width) of 4 meters; it has
a flat bottom and sails in rivers, propelled by either oars, a small
sail, or a pole.

**Boat, sailing:** a single-masted sailboat, typically 10m long and with
a beam of 4 meters. Often used for fishing in lakes or along the
shorelines.

**Canoe:** a light boat built from a light wood frame wrapped with hide,
canvas, or other thin waterproofed covering. Used in rivers and swamps.
5m long, 2m wide.

**Cart:** a two-wheeled open vehicle pulled by two heavy horses or
mules.

**Donkey:** a sturdy ass. A beast of burden and draft animal; hardy and
sure-footed.

**Edmontosaurus:** a bulky four-legged dinosaur weighing up to 4 tons,
with a long, laterally flattened tail and a head with an expanded,
duck-like beak. Edmontosauri are quite docile and readily tamed. A
war-trained edmontosaurus costs 3000₢.

**Elephant:** one of Old Terra's mightiest and most memorable animals. A
war-trained elephant costs 3500₢.

**Galley, merchant:** a large, deck-covered ship with a single mast,
square sail, and multiple banks of oars. Typically, 50m long. Requires a
captain, 20 sailors, and 180 rowers. May carry up to 50 additional
passengers.

**Galley, war:** a taller military version of the merchant galley. This
war galley has two masts and four rows of rowers under its deck.
Requires a captain, 30 sailors, and 300 rowers. May carry up to 75
additional passengers or marines.

**Horse, heavy:** such sturdy, if slow, horses are usually trained for
draft (i.e. pulling carts, plows, or other heavy loads), though
sometimes they are trained for war instead (in which case such a horse
costs 70₢).

**Horse, light:** a fast, lean horse. May be trained for riding or war
(in the latter case, such a horse costs 150₢); these breeds are too
fragile to be trained for draft.

**Lizard, giant:** a fantastic giant lizard, larger than a horse, tamed
and ready for riding. A war-trained giant lizard is a terror to behold,
and costs 1000₢.

**Longship:** a graceful, light warship with a single mast, square sail,
and a row of rowers on each side. Operates easily in oceans, shorelines,
lakes and rivers – a versatile ship often used by raiders. Requires a
captain and 75 sailors, 60 of whom may row when the wind is low; they
also serve as marines.

**Mule:** the infertile offspring of a donkey and a horse. Often ornery
and stubborn.

**Sailing ship, large:** a massive three-masted seaworthy ship dwarfing
all other primitive watercraft. It is 50m long and 10wide. It has at
least one deck and two raised "castles" in its bow and stern. The large
sailing ship requires a captain and 20 sailors.

**Sailing ship, small:** a smaller sailing ship with a single mast; 20m
long, 6m wide, and requires a captain and 9 sailors.

**Wagon:** a four-wheeled open vehicle drawn by two to four heavy horses
(or one edmontosaurus).

### Weapons

Barbarians and knights meet their foes with blade and arrow. Here we
provide a collection of weapons, both for melee and ranged combat.

#### Stats Explanation

**Range:** Effective/Maximum in meters. To attack with a ranged weapon
within effective range throw Archery (or Artillery) 8+; beyond effective
range, throw Archery (or Artillery) 10+.

**Damage:** damage caused by the weapon.

**Ammo Cost:** per quiver (usually 20 arrows or bolts), in gold pieces.

**Cost:** The weapon’s cost, in gold pieces.

#### Weapon Aspects

Weapons have Aspects describing their special characteristics, as noted
on their table.

**AV X:** anti-vehicular dice. Throw this number of dice when you hit a
vehicle; if the throw is equal or greater than the vehicle’s armor
rating, the shot penetrates and causes a Light or Critical damage roll.
Use this rating only when fighting against vehicles (such as
watercraft).

**Blast X:** This weapon damages targets in its blast radius. The number
given is the blast radius in meters. A character caught within the blast
radius may throw DEX 8+ to dodge the blast and suffer only half the
damage (rounded down).

**Bulky:** A Bulky weapon is extremely heavy – this makes it difficult
to use effectively in combat by someone of a weak physical stature.
Characters with STR 8 or less suffer DM-2 when using such weapons. Bulky
weapons cannot be used from the back of a mount.

**Fire:** On a successful hit, throw 6+ for the target to catch fire. A
burning target takes 2D damage per combat round for 1D rounds, or until
the fire is extinguished.

**Mounted:** This weapon is especially suitable for use from a mount
(such as a horse) and grants DM+1 when attacking from a mount's back.

**Reach:** This weapon has a longer reach and characters using a weapon
with Reach enjoy a DM+1 to initiative throws (see the Combat chapter for
details).

**Thrown:** May be thrown. Effective range when throwing is STR in
meters, and the maximum range is STRx2 in meters.

**Two-Handed:** Requires both hands to use (precludes the use of a
shield). Weapons without this Aspect are one-handed by default.

#### Melee Weapons

The following weapons use the Melee Combat skill. Larger melee weapons
may harm light vehicles, such as a rowboat or a chariot, but are totally
ineffective against larger ships.

**Battleax:** a larger one-handed ax designed for war.

**Broadsword:** a large two-handed sword, counts as 2 “Items” for
encumbrance purposes.

**Club:** the simplest of weapons – a heavy stick, sometimes with added
spikes.

**Cudgel:** a large club or mace.

**Cutlass:** a short, broad slashing sword with a slightly curved blade
and basket-guard hilt. Traditionally used by marines and pirates.

**Great-Axe:** a massive two-handed axe. Counts as two items for
encumbrance purposes.

**Halberd:** a wide slashing blade and a long spike mounted atop a long
shaft; the back of blade includes a hook. Counts as two items for

purposes.

**Pike:** a particularly long spear, used by massed troop formations.

as two items for encumbrance purposes.

**Shield:** a personal shield, which can bash enemies for 1D damage and
applies DM-2 to opponents trying to hit its bearer. If a shield is used
with the overwatch action in combat, the wielder is treated as having
partial cover.

Designed as a cavalry weapon.

**Spear:** from a sharpened shaft to a metal-tipped spear, this is a
basic, yet effective, melee weapon.

two hands.

**Sword:** one of any variety of longer medium-sized one-handed swords.

**Sword, Short:** an intermediate weapon between the dagger and the

**Ballista:** essentially a massive crossbow, this siege weapon hurls
immense bolts at its targets. It does not have a minimum range. The
ballista suffers DM-2 against low-flying targets.

**Catapults:** siege weapons powered by either torsion or a
counter-weight mechanism, hurling rocks or other projectiles. Catapults
have a minimum range (150m for the light catapult and 200m for the heavy
catapult). They cause damage to characters within a "blast" radius of
their impact

#### Pitch Shots

Catapults may launch incendiary pitch shots. These cost 25₢ each and are
particularly effective against personnel and wooden ships. They gain the
Fire aspect against all targets in their blast radius.

#### Silver Weapons

Some monsters are vulnerable to silver weapons. A silver weapon costs
10x the base cost. For example, a silver sabre will cost 120₢.

### Hirelings and ***<span class="smallcaps">Mercenaries</span>***

In addition to buying equipment, arms, and mounts, characters may want
to hire mercenaries, retainers, and various specialists. In a nutshell,
mercenaries are ordinary hired soldiers who serve for conventional
military tasks – from guarding a fortress to attacking enemy
strongholds; they usually operate as part of a larger military force.
Retainers are NPCs brave (or foolhardy) enough to accompany player
characters into the kinds of hair-raising adventures players love to put
their characters through. Specialists are, as the term implies,
tradesmen or experts in various useful non-combat (or combat-adjacent)
fields.

All hirelings come with ordinary equipment appropriate for their
profession, subject to the Referee’s discretion. For example, a typical
light infantryman will come equipped with leather armor, a shield, and a
short sword or spear. An armorer or alchemist would have their tools.
The employer (the PCs) would have to supply heavy equipment, such as a
forge or laboratory.

#### Hiring Negotiations

To hire NPCs, the players must first negotiate with them. The Referee
will usually do this by role-playing the prospective hireling, by
rolling on the hireling negotiation table (see below), or – most likely
– using a combination of roleplay and dice rolls.

Searching for hirelings costs 3D gold per week. The characters must
throw money around, spreading word that they are looking for qualified
employees, and are able to pay reliably.

To recruit a single retainer, specialist, or mercenary squad, throw
Liaison 8+, note the effect, and consult the following table.
Mercenaries usually share a single negotiation throw for an entire squad
(8-12 soldiers) or even a platoon (approximately 40 soldiers), at the
Referee's discretion. There may be additional DMs to this throw, such as
DM-1 for a particularly dangerous mission or DM+1 if the PCs offer a
hiring bonus equal to one month's pay.

Depending on circumstances, the prospective employer may substitute
Streetwise or Carousing to Liaison in this throw, at the Referee's
discretion.

**Hiring reactions**

| **Effect**   | **Result**            |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| -6 or worse  | Refuse and slander    |
| -5 to -3     | Refuse                |
| -2 to -1     | Try again             |
| +0 to +3     | Accept                |
| +4 or better | Accept in good spirit |

**Refuse and slander:** the hireling refuses the offer and will spread
cruel rumors about the employer, causing DM-1 to any further hiring
throws in this locale and surrounding area for the next month.

**Refuse:** the hireling declines the offer.

**Try again:** the prospective employer may improve the offer (e.g. by
offering better pay), and throw again.

**Accept:** the hireling accepts the offer.

**Accept in good spirit:** the hireling is excited to work for the
employer and gains DM+1 to morale throws.

#### Mercenaries

Mercenaries are soldiers (or thugs) who perform military (or thuggery)
operations. They may guard, patrol, assault enemy strongholds, engage
enemy forces, or even waylay unwary travelers. However, they are not
foolish enough to follow lunatics on harrowing adventures such as
robbing haunted tombs or sneaking into an enemy's castle to assassinate
a noble. That’s way above their pay scale. They’re soldiers.

Ordinary mercenaries have either Melee Combat-1 and Archery-0 or
Archery-1 and Melee Combat-0 as appropriate. Cavalry also have Riding-1.
Thugs have only Melee-0 and Archery-0. Mercenaries have a morale DM+0,
except for thugs, who have a morale DM-2.

Mercenary come equipped per the table below. Players may purchase better
equipment for their mercenaries, of course. Purchased equipment is
usually returned at the end of the contract unless negotiated otherwise.

The following table shows mercenary troop types, equipment, monthly
upkeep cost (in gold), and availability based on settlement size.

**Mercenaries**

| **Type**       | **Equipment**                                             | **Monthly cost** | **Number available per week** |          |                |

| Horse archers  | Short bow, sword, leather armor, light war horse          | ₢45              | \-                            | 1D       | 1Dx10          |

#### Retainers

Retainers are NPCs willing to serve adventurers as bodyguards, henchmen,
or sidekicks. Unlike mercenaries, they are loyal enough to follow their
master and will put themselves in grave danger. Retainers may operate
individually rather than as part of a larger unit. However, they require
a higher monthly fee, and they must receive one fifth (20%) of their
master’s share of the treasure gained through adventure. A retainer’s
monthly fee is 12₢ a month for an unskilled character (e.g. an
18-years-old farm boy with an adventurous spirit) or 25₢ multiplied by
the number of terms the retainer served in their career.

A character may at most have 2 retainers, modified by their SOC DM, and
one more for each point of Leadership skill (if any; Leadership-0 does
not count for this sake). Regardless of SOC, a character will always be
able to have at least one retainer. For example, a character with SOC 9
and Leadership 2 could retain as many as 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 retainers.
Another character with SOC 4 and no leadership could hire at most 2 – 1
= 1 retainer.

The Referee must generate prospective retainers as regular characters
using the character generation rules. Note that this is always subject
to Referee discretion. Many highly skilled characters with an
adventurous streak might prefer to strike out on their own rather than
serve other adventurers.

Retainers come with appropriate basic gear, as received from character
generation or purchased from gold generated on the Gold mustering out
table.

Just like mercenaries, retainers have a Morale DM. In their case, it is
equal to DM+0 plus their employer's Leadership skill (minimum 0). The
Referee may increase this DM if the employer treats their retainer
particularly well or decrease it for bad treatment. Retainers who suffer
serious misfortunes will require their employer to throw Leadership 8+
(if there is no Leadership skill, treat the character as having
Leadership-0) and consult the following table to determine their
loyalty; Add the retainer’s Morale score as a DM. Some examples of
misfortune include surviving a mortal wound, being cursed, or being
treated particularly badly by the employer. The Referee may also require
a loyalty throw in other cases, such as a retainer being left to guard a
particularly valuable treasure unsupervised.

**Retainer loyalty**

| **Loyalty Effect** | **Result**      |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| -6 or worse        | Hostility       |
| -5 to -3           | Resignation     |
| -2 to -1           | Disappointment  |
| +0 to +3           | Loyalty         |
| +4 or better       | Fanatic loyalty |

**Hostility:** the retainer leaves and becomes an Enemy of the former
employer. May steal from their employer beforehand or harm them
otherwise.

**Resignation:** the retainer leaves without bearing any grudge towards
their former employer.

**Disappointment:** the retainer is disappointed with the employer but
does not leave. DM-1 to Morale (cumulative).

**Loyalty:** all is as before.

**Fanatic loyalty:** the retainer forms a particularly strong bond with
their employer. DM+1 to morale (not cumulative).

#### Specialists

Player characters can hire tradesmen and professionals for various
tasks, such as sailors to crew a ship, or an alchemist to produce
potions. Specialists are usually non-combatants, though this is subject
to Referee discretion and the specific task the specialist was hired to
do. For example, siege engineers are generally considered to be
combatants, though they would expect to never be in immediate danger.

The specialist’s relevant skill level determines how much they are paid.
For example, a sailor's relevant skill is Watercraft, while an
alchemist's relevant skill is Alchemy. The following table indicates
specialist skill levels and associated monthly wage costs. Skill-0
denotes apprentices. Rowers on ships have Watercraft-0.

Hiring unskilled laborers, such as porters, costs 1₢ per month.

**Specialist monthly wages**

| **Skill** | **Monthly wage (₢)** |
|-----------|----------------------|
| 0         | ₢12                  |
| 1         | ₢25                  |
| 2         | ₢75                  |
| 3         | ₢300                 |
| 4         | ₢500                 |
| 5         | ₢1,000               |

# CHAPTER 7: PERSONAL COMBAT

Personal combat is a common means of resolving conflicts. This chapter
provides detailed rules for personal combat.

## Personal Combat Checklist

Personal combat in the Märchen Engine is cyclical. Everybody acts in
turn in a regular cycle called a round. Generally, combat runs in the
following way:

1.  The Referee determines which characters are aware of their opponents
    at the start of the battle. If some but not all combatants are aware
    of their opponents, the combatants that are aware of their opponents
    are considered to get an automatic 12 on their initiative roll,
    giving them an Initiative of 12 + Dexterity DM.

2.  Any remaining combatants roll initiative. All combatants are now
    ready to begin their first round of combat.

3.  Combatants act in initiative order.

4.  When everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest
    initiative total acts again, and steps 4 and 5 repeat until combat
    ends.

## Range 

Personal combat is divided into a series of range bands. These are
identified in the Personal Combat Range Bands table.

#### Table: Personal Combat Range Bands

| Range     | Distance to Target       | Squares to Target                     |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Personal  | Less than 1.5 meters     | 0 (combatants are in the same square) |
| Close     | 1.5 to 3 meters          | 1 to 2 squares                        |
| Short     | 3 to 12 meters           | 3 to 8 squares                        |
| Medium    | 12 to 50 meters          | 9 to 34 squares                       |
| Long      | 51 meters to 250 meters  | 35 to 166 squares                     |
| Very Long | 251 meters to 500 meters | 167 to 334 squares                    |
| Distant   | 501 meters+              | 334 squares+                          |

The Difficulty of any attack is based on the weapon type and the range
of the attack, as per the Attack Difficulties by Weapon Type table.

#### Table: Attack Difficulties by Weapon Type

| Weapon         | Personal       | Close     | Short     | Medium    | Long           | Very Long      | Distant        |

| Assault Weapon | Difficult      | Average   | Average   | Average   | Difficult      | Very Difficult | Formidable     |
| Rocket         | Very Difficult | Difficult | Difficult | Average   | Average        | Difficult      | Very Difficult |

### Starting Range

When a combat begins, the Referee must decide the starting range that
separates the groups of combatants. For combat in tight quarters, such
as inside an office complex or starship, or within an underground tunnel
system, the starting range is usually Short. The range for outdoor
encounters is usually Medium, although open areas such as prairies,
deserts, open roads and ocean surfaces make it easier to see at a
distance, so Long or even Very Long range would not be inappropriate.
Total darkness reduces starting range to Short or less. Partial darkness
restricts starting range to Medium or less.

## Surprise

Characters may surprise other parties or be surprised by them. A good
tactician or a keen-eyed scout can lay a good ambush or avoid one.

In situations where surprise is possible, each party throws Recon 8+.
The Unskilled penalty applies to this roll. If one party succeeds and
the other fails, the winner gains surprise. If both sides succeed or
both fail, there is no surprise. A party deliberately setting up ambush
gains DM+2 to surprise rolls. Groups in vehicles, or groups of
characters numbering 8 or more members, suffer DM-2 to surprise rolls.

Surprise grants a “free” combat round during which the surprising party
may act, but the surprised party may not.

## Initiative

If the combatants are all unprepared for combat, then each rolls 2D6 and
adds their Dexterity DM to determine starting Initiative. Initiative
determines the order that characters act in, but it can also be spent to
react to events. If some of the combatants are ready for combat and some
are not, such as in an ambush, the prepared characters are considered to
get an automatic 12 on their roll, giving them an Initiative of 12 +
Dexterity DM. Characters that are aware of a group, and that group is
unaware of them, may elect to avoid conflict entirely.

Characters that have the Tactics skill may make a Tactics check and add
the Effect of this check to the Initiative of everyone in their unit
with whom they are in direct communication.

## The Combat Round 

Each combat round lasts around six seconds of game time. In a combat
round each character gets a minor action and a significant action.
Actions are taken in descending order of Initiative. If two characters
have the same Initiative, the character with the highest Dexterity goes
first. If they are still tied, then characters act simultaneously. When
a character acts, he takes all his actions at once.

Once everyone has acted a combat round is over and a new round begins.
Initiative is not re-rolled but is dynamic, and may be adjusted up and
down by actions taken during a round.

### Dynamic Initiative 

During the course of a round a character's Initiative score may be
changed by reactions and hastening. Any changes affect your Initiative
for one round only – either the current round if you have yet to act or
the following round if you have acted already. Reactions reduce your
Initiative in order to allow you to defend yourself from attacks.
Hastening your action lets you act sooner but at a penalty to your roll.

At the start of each combat round a character may declare that he is
acting hastily. This gives him a +2 bonus to his Initiative for that
round only but all his actions receive a –1 DM. A character can only
hasten once.

## Minor Actions

Minor actions are actions intended to move a distance or to manipulate
or move an object. You can take up to three minor actions per round, at
the loss of a significant action.

### Aiming 

A character that spends a minor action aiming at a target gets a +1 DM
to his next attack on the target, as long as the character does nothing
except aim until he makes his attack. A character may spend multiple
actions on aiming, gaining a maximum aiming DM of +6 if he spends six
minor actions on aiming.

### Aiming for the Kill

Specifically aiming for a kill works exactly like regular Aiming, but
does not add to the character’s DM to hit the target. Instead, the
character gains a bonus of +2 to his damage equal to the number of minor
actions he spends Aiming for the Kill. He cannot dodge, duck, or move
while aiming. He also loses his Aim bonus if hit or distracted. The
maximum bonus obtainable from Aiming for the Kill is +6.

### Changing Stance 

A character can change to any one of the three stances – prone, crouched
or standing – as a minor action.

### Drawing and Reloading 

The time taken to draw a weapon depends on its size and ease of use. The
number of minor actions to ready or reload a weapon is listed in the
description of each weapon. Most weapons take one minor action to draw
and another minor action to reload, but some weapons are especially fast
or slow.

### Movement 

The character moves up to six meters. When using a square grid for
modelling the combat, each square should measure 1.5 meters to the side.
This means that the average character moves four squares on his turn.
Difficult terrain, such as rubble, mud or thick under-brush can halve a
character's movement, allowing him to move only three meters per
movement action. Crouching also halves movement.

### Miscellaneous 

The Referee may permit a character to perform a skill check or other
action as a minor action if the use of the skill does not require the
character's full attention or complex physical actions.

## Significant Actions

Significant actions are intended to do something within about 3 seconds.
You can perform a single significant action per round, or forego it to
perform a total of three minor actions.

### Two Minor Actions 

A character can take two minor actions instead of a significant action.

### Miscellaneous 

A character may make a skill check or do something else as a significant
action when such an action requires the character's full attention,
concentration, complicated physical actions or some combination thereof.
Any skill check with a time interval of 1-6 seconds is simply considered
a significant action during combat.

### Attack 

The most common significant action is an attack. The basic attack action
is trying to injure a foe with a melee attack or a ranged weapon. The
attacker declares his target, and the foe may choose to react. The
attacker then makes a skill check, and if successful, deals damage to
his target. The actual Difficulty of this skill check is determined
using the weapon type and the range of the attack, as given earlier in
this chapter under **Range**.

The standard skill checks used in making an attack are:

- **Melee Attack** = 2D6 + appropriate melee combat skill + Strength or
  Dexterity DM (attacker's choice)

- **Shooting Attack** = 2D6 + appropriate gun combat skill + Dexterity
  DM

- **Thrown Attack** = 2D6 + Athletics + Dexterity DM

#### Table: Common Modifiers to Attacks in Personal Combat 

| Action                                | Modifier                                                  |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Aiming                                | +1 per Aim action                                         |
| Cover                                 | –0 to –6                                                  |
| Environmental Effects                 | –1 to –2                                                  |
| Intelligent Weapon                    | +1 if total DM is within the program's tolerance          |
| Laser Sight                           | +1 if aiming                                              |
| Movement                              | –1 for every 10 full meters of target movement            |
| Target Dodges (Reaction)              | –1                                                        |
| Target Parries (Reaction)             | –Defender's appropriate melee skill                       |
| Target Stance                         | –2 if attacking a prone target at Medium or greater range |
|                                       | +2 if attacking a prone target at Personal range          |
| Weapons with Recoil (in Zero Gravity) | –2                                                        |

### Coup de Grace

A character can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a
helpless opponent that is within close range. They can also use a ranged
weapon to do so, provided they are adjacent to the target. The attack
automatically hit and the opponent dies.

## Reactions 

Reactions are actions taken immediately in response to the action of
another. The more time a character spends reacting, the longer it will
be until he acts himself. Each reaction lowers Initiative by 2 and
applies a –1 DM to all skill checks until the following round. There is
no limit to how many times a character can react in a round but a
character can only react once to each attack and the penalties from
reacting are cumulative.

A character can only react to attacks that he is aware of.

### Dodging 

A character who is being attacked may dodge, giving his attacker a –1 DM
and giving himself a –1 DM on all skill checks until the next round. If
the character is in cover or has an obstruction to duck or dodge behind,
the DM to hit him is increased to –2.

### Parrying 

A character who is being attacked in melee can parry, applying his Melee
skill as a negative DM equal to the attack roll. A parrying character
also has a –1 DM on all skill checks until the next round.

## Other Actions 

Other types of action can take place during personal combat.

### Free Actions 

Some actions are so fast they do not even qualify as a minor action –
shouting a warning, pushing a button, checking your watch, and so on. A
character can perform as many of these free actions as he likes in a
turn, although if he performs several the Referee may require him to
spend a minor or even a significant action on his various tasks.

### Extended Actions 

Some skill checks will take longer than a single combat round to
complete. Make a Timing roll for the task and then work out how many six
second combat rounds it will take to complete. A character engaging in
an extended action cannot do anything else but can abandon their action
at any time and return to the normal Initiative order. A character who
is hit by an attack while undertaking an extended action must make an 8+
roll using the skill in question with a negative DM equal to the amount
of damage the attack causes (after armor). Failure indicates that this
round's work does not count towards the completion of the task. Failure
by six or more (an Exceptional Failure) ruins the task and the character
must start again.

### Delay 

A character does not have to act when his turn comes up in the
Initiative order. He may act at any later point during the round, even
interrupting another's actions to do so. When he acts, his Initiative is
set to the count on which he acted. If the character has not acted by
the end of the round he may choose to act first in the next round,
effectively giving up his actions in the previous round in exchange for
an Initiative advantage. His new Initiative is set to one higher than
that of the current first person in the order. When multiple characters
are delaying and all wish to act first in the following round, their
Initiatives are all set to the same score and they act in Dexterity
order as normal.

## Special Considerations 

The following are special considerations in Personal Combat.

### Battlefield Comms 

Communications technology is a vital part of the battlefield. If a
character is not in communication with the rest of his unit and his
commander, then he cannot benefit from Tactics or Leadership. Characters
that benefitted from Tactics at the start of combat and are later cut
off from their commander have their Initiative lowered by the same
amount it was boosted at the start of combat. Unlike other Initiative
modifications, this lasts until combat ends or communication is
re-established. There are several methods of communication:

- **Direct**: This covers hand signals and verbal communications.

- **Hardlinks**: Hardlinks are wires or other physical connections, and
  cannot be jammed.

- **Radio**: Radio communications allow communications as long as the
  radio signal can get through – they can be jammed or blocked by local
  conditions.

- **Laser**: Two characters with tight beam lasers are in communication
  as long as line of sight exists between a character and another
  friendly laser-comm equipped character.

- **Masers**: These work just like lasers, but can cut through smoke and
  aerosols.

- **Meson**: Meson communicators cannot be jammed or blocked, but cannot
  be used while a character is moving.

### Battlefield Conditions

Certain battlefield conditions affect ranged attacks:

- **Darkness**: Low light gives a –1 DM to ranged attacks. Complete
  darkness gives a –4 DM. Light penalties can be avoided by using
  sensors to target instead of the naked eye.

- **Smoke or Fog**: Smoke gives a –1 DM to ranged attacks by obscuring
  the target; especially thick and impenetrable smoke gives a –2 DM.
  These penalties are doubled for laser weapons.

- **Extreme Weather**: Driving wind, rain, snowstorms and so forth give
  a –1 DM to ranged attacks from poor visibility and a –1 DM to ranged
  attacks from environmental interference. Sensors can be used to avoid
  the visibility penalty.

### Battlefield Sensors 

There are several types of sensors.

- **Bioscanner**: Bioscanner ‘sniffers' detect airborne pathogens and
  hazardous chemicals.

- **Infra-Red (Heat)**: Infra-red sensors detect warm bodies, and negate
  concealment from smoke and soft cover, but can be jammed by strong
  heat sources.

- **Densitometer**: An outgrowth of gravitic technology, a densitometer
  can scan an area and plot variable densities, effectively creating a
  three-dimensional map of all objects.

- **Electromagnetic Detectors**: These sensors can detect unshielded
  high-power electrical devices, such as gauss weapons or transmitters.

- **Laser-Assisted Targeting**: A low-powered laser is reflected off the
  target, giving targeting data to the firer.

- **Light Intensification**: Light intensification technology magnifies
  visible light, negating the penalties for darkness or low light.

- **Motion Sensors**: Can detect motion within range.

- **Neural Activity Sensor (NAS)**: A combination of highly sensitive
  EM-detectors and psionic theory, NAS detectors pick up on the brain
  activity of living beings and classify them according to amount and
  complexity, giving a rough idea of the intelligence of subjects.

### Blind Firing

Blind firing works exactly like any other form of firing (including
automatic), but it always treats the firer as having Level 0 in that
weapon’s relative skill. Additionally an extra die is thrown when
firing, but before any calculations are made the highest die (or one of
the highest, in case of a tie) is removed completely. Any successful
attack(s) needs to then have a die rolled to randomly choose which
eligible target in the firing line is hit – whether friend or foe.

### Burst Fire

Weapons that fire a burst of 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, or 100 rounds may improve
the attacker’s odds of either hitting a target or inflict additional
damage. The attacker must decide whether to spray the target, increasing
the chances of scoring a hit, or to fire a precise, grouped burst in the
hope of inflicting greater damage. Either sort of burst fire is
considered a significant action.

#### Table: Burst Fire Effects

| Burst Size      | Attack DM | Extra Damage       |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------------|
| 1 round         | +0        | +0 damage          |
| 3 round burst   | +1        | +1 point of damage |
| 4 round burst   | +1        | +1D6 damage        |
| 10 round burst  | +2        | +2D6 damage        |
| 20 round burst  | +3        | +3D6 damage        |
| 100 round burst | +4        | +4D6 damage        |

### Cover 

Any sort of low wall, undergrowth, convenient rocks or other objects can
serve as cover. Attacks made on characters who are behind cover suffer
the negative cover DM on the Cover Modifiers table below. Crouching or
prone targets can claim cover one step higher on the table. If a
character in full cover is crouching or prone they are impossible to hit
but cannot return fire.

#### Table: Cover Modifiers

| Cover                                               | Cover DM |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1/4 (undergrowth, small rock, corner of a building) | –0       |
| 1/2 (thick forest, low wall, crate)                 | –1       |
| 3/4 (jungle, trench, reinforced position)           | –2       |
| Full (pillbox)                                      | –4       |

### Explosions 

Grenades, rockets and other explosives affect an area. A character
caught in an explosion may dodge at the usual Initiative cost. A
character that dodges an explosion may reduce the damage by 1D6 if he
just dodges or by half if he dives for cover. A character that dives for
cover ends up prone and loses his next significant action.

### Extreme Range Firing

Any weapon that has the ability to fire into the Distant range band
(including ranged(Rifle), ranged(Assault Weapon) and ranged(Rocket)
attacks) can potentially strike targets even beyond, so long as the
firer can see the target. Weapons fired at this extreme range do so
using the modifiers for Distant range with an additional DM of –2. Only
characters with at least three levels of skill in the weapon may fire at
extreme range. To fire at extreme range, characters must be stationary
and prepared to fire from some kind of rest (tripod, tree limb, bunker
embrasure and so on). Vehicles must be stationary for weapons to be
fired at extreme range from it. Energy-based weapons (lasers, PGMPs, and
so on) inflict half damage (round up) at this extreme range.

This can be combined with Aiming for the Kill (above).

### Fighting in Zero Gravity

When fighting in zero gravity, a character's skill levels are limited to
lower of the character's Zero-G skill and the appropriate combat skill.
For example, if a character has Laser Pistol-2 and Zero-G-1, then the
character shoots with an effective skill level of 1, since his Zero-G
skill level is lower than his Laser Pistol skill level. Characters
without Zero-G skill are treated as unskilled in their attack, because
of the disorientation. In addition, characters using weapons with recoil
suffer a DM -2 on attack rolls when fighting in zero gravity conditions.

### Firing into Combat 

If a character is firing a weapon at a target that is at Personal range
to another combatant, then the attack suffers a –2 DM. If the attack
misses, roll 1D6. On a 4+, the attack hits the nearest other combatant
to the original target.

### Frenzy

A character with at least Melee Combat-1 who either kills or disables an
enemy in melee combat may move 1.5m and immediately attack an adjacent
enemy. Characters may do so in the same combat action for a number of
times equal to their Melee Combat skill

### Grappling 

A character can attempt to wrestle or grab another person instead of
hitting him. The attacker must move to Personal range and beat his
target in an opposed Natural Weapons skill check. If he wins, he may do
any one of the following:

- Continue the grapple with no other effects.

- Disarm his opponent. If he succeeds by 6+ he can take the weapon away;
  otherwise it ends up on the floor.

- Drag his opponent up to three meters.

- Escape the grapple and move away (as if with a normal movement
  action).

- Inflict damage equal to 2 + the Effect + STR DM.

- Knock his opponent prone.

- Throw his opponent up to three meters for 1D6 +STR DM damage.

Throwing an opponent always ends the grapple. With any other option the
winner can choose to end or continue the grapple as he sees fit. A
character in a grapple cannot move nor do anything other than make
opposed Natural Weapons skill checks. Each time an opposed check is made
the winner can choose an option from the above list.

### Panic Fire

In order to call upon Panic Fire, a character must be using some form of
small arms slug thrower. Panic fire uses all remaining rounds in the
weapon, and hits are resolved as if the weapon were being fired using
the Burst Fire rules for damage (not for accuracy). There is a DM –2
penalty to hit.

### Shotgun Spread

Any shotgun loaded specifically with flechette rounds can be fired like
a common round at a single target up to Short range, using the standard
statistics for the weapon. If firing at a target or group of targets at
Medium or Long range, the frag shell has its damage reduced to 2d6 but
gains a DM+1 bonus to hit, and can hit not only the target aimed at but
also anyone (friend or foe) in Personal range with the initial target.

### Suppression Fire

Suppression fire works by having the character actually target the areas
surrounding the target; a wall, a tree or even the ground at their feet
are all perfectly suitable. The impact of the character’s attacks are
often enough to give pause to a potential attacker. The firing character
rolls his shooting attack as normal, except with a –2 DM for trying to
hit cover and nearby objects to the target(s). This attack action also
uses up double the normal amount of ammunition per attack. Failures are
treated as normal misses. Success means that the firer has hit close
enough to the target to force them to duck away, stalling their next
action by adding an initiative penalty equal to the Effect of the
attack. Suppressed targets also receive a DM-1 penalty to any skill
checks that they try to perform in both the current and following combat
round.

Automatic fire can be used for Suppression fire, but no target can be
affected twice by Suppression fire on the same action. The target must
be allowed to take one action before he can be suppressed again. If
multiple hits are used upon the same target, the highest Effect takes
precedence.

There are some situations and instances that can make a target so
unshakeable that they do not care about Suppression fire, and will not
be harried by it. Some of those exceptions are found on the list below.

- Vehicles, or targets fully enclosed in vehicles

- Zealots

- Mechanical or android targets

- Targets wearing full Battle Dress

- Suicidal targets

### Stance 

A character can be standing, crouched or prone.

**Standing**: A standing character uses the normal rules.

**Crouching**: A crouching character moves at half speed but can make
better use of cover. If a crouching character is in cover, consider it
one row lower on the Cover Modifiers table. For example, if a character
is crouching behind a waist-high wall, he is considered to be at 3/4
cover rather than 1/2 cover.

**Prone**: A prone character cannot make melee attacks or dodge. He may
make improved use of cover like a crouching character and he may still
parry melee attacks. All ranged attacks targeting him suffer a –2 DM
penalty. At Close range, the penalty is reduced to +0; a prone character
being attacked at Personal range grants a +2 DM to attacks against him.

### Tactics and Leadership 

The Tactics skill can be used to give an Initiative bonus to a whole
unit at the start of combat. The unit commander may make a Tactics
check, and everyone in the unit may increase their Initiative by the
Effect of the check.

The Leadership skill can be used to increase another character's
Initiative. The character with Leadership makes a Leadership check, and
the target character's Initiative is increased by the Effect of the
check. Making a Leadership skill check is a significant action.

### Thrown Weapons 

There are two kinds of thrown weapons: the first kind strike a single
target and do damage from the force of their impact, such as throwing
knives or a thrown rock. These use the normal rules for ranged combat.
The other kind of thrown weapon is a grenade or other explosive
projectile that inflicts no damage from impact but typically delivers a
harmful payload. The first kind of thrown weapon adds the Effect of the
Athletics check to its damage. The second does not.

If the attack fails the projectile scatters in a random direction for
(6 + Effect) meters. This is usually only important if the projectile
explodes on or after impact.

## Damage 

Each weapon lists the damage it inflicts as a number of D6. Add the
Effect of the attack roll to this damage.

The first time a character takes damage, it is applied to the target's
Endurance. If a target is reduced to Endurance 0, then further damage is
subtracted from the target's Strength or Dexterity (of the character’s
choice). If either Strength or Dexterity is reduced to 0, the character
is unconscious and any further damage is subtracted from the remaining
physical characteristic. If all three physical characteristics are
reduced to 0, the character is killed.

Once a character has taken damage, any damage from subsequent attacks is
allocated to any of the three physical characteristics as the character
so chooses.

#### Table: Damage Results

| Characteristic Damage                | Result                         |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| At least 1 characteristic is damaged | Character is wounded           |
| All 3 characteristics are damaged    | Character is seriously wounded |
| 2 characteristics are at Zero        | Character is unconscious       |
| 3 characteristics are at Zero        | Character is dead              |

### Armor 

Armor reduces damage by the value of the armor. A hit with Effect 6+
always inflicts at least one point of damage, regardless of the target's
armor.

### Fatigue

A character can become fatigued in numerous ways, such as staying awake
too long, over-exerting themselves or even using certain medications. A
fatigued character suffers a –2 DM to all checks until he rests. The
amount of rest needed is 3 – the character's Endurance DM hours . If a
character suffers fatigue while already fatigued they fall unconscious.

### Knockdown

If a character receives more damage, before armor is applied, in one
round than their two highest physical characteristics combined (that is,
sufficient to seriously wound an unarmored character), they are knocked
prone. This rule applies even when the character receives no damage at
all thanks to armor. Prone characters, unless they get up, attack at
DM-2 and crawl at half speed, but are, as noted above, at DM-2 to hit
with ranged weapons.

### Knocking down mounted characters

A mounted charter who takes damage equal to their full STR
characteristic or greater before applying armor must throw Riding 6+ or
be knocked off the saddle. Falling from a mount causes 1D damage, and
the character ends up prone, as noted above.

### Unconsciousness

An unconscious character may make an Endurance check after every minute
of unconsciousness – if successful, he regains consciousness. If he
fails he must wait another minute and can then try again with a +1 DM on
the check for every check previously failed.

### Optional Rule: Heroes vs. Grunts

For a more cinematic game where heroes cut their way through waves of
grunts (also called "mooks"), use the standard wounding rules given
above for heroes and villains, while grunts fall unconscious for 1D
minutes when one of their characteristics fall to zero. If you combine
this with the Frenzy rule, it is perfectly possible for a hero to wade
through a group of opponents without breaking too much of a sweat.

## Injury and Recovery

Injured characters are either wounded or seriously wounded. A character
is considered seriously wounded if he has lost at least one point from
all three of his physical characteristics. As soon as one of his
physical characteristics is restored, no matter how, he is no longer
seriously wounded.

Seriously wounded characters who have somehow avoided unconsciousness
cannot move except to hobble or crawl along at 1.5 meters per combat
round. They also lose their minor action in combat.

Wounded characters heal naturally and can also benefit from medical
care. When characteristic points return from healing, players may choose
which characteristic regains the points and may split healing between
characteristics if they wish.

### Healing

**Minor Wounds** require treatment by a character with at least
Medicine-1, which takes an hour. Alternatively, characters will recover
from all Minor Wounds on their own after a full day’s rest. Treatment or
rest restores the wounded character's full characteristic scores and
removes any minor wounds penalty.

**Serious Wounds** require treatment by a skilled healer (Medicine-1
skill or better). Recovery takes 5D days. No recovery from Serious
Wounds is possible without a healer's care.

Note that there are spells and potions which can accelerate a wounded
character’s healing rate.

### Wounds

If at least two physical characteristics of the wounded character remain
above 0, the character has suffered **Minor Wounds**. Use the reduced
characteristics for any relevant characteristic throws.

If one characteristic falls to 0 the character suffers DM-1 to all
actions but may keep fighting.

If two characteristics are reduced to 0, the character is **Seriously
Wounded**; they must throw8+ or fall unconscious for 1D hours;
otherwise, they suffer DM-2 to all skill and attack throws until healed.
Upon waking, the character’s wounded characteristics are 1. The
character will require medical care to recover any further.

Characters **suffer a mortal wound and may die** if all three physical
characteristics reach 0.

### Mortal Wounds

A character whose all three physical characteristics fall to zero is
mortally wounded. However, there is still some hope - given the prompt
attention of a skilled healer. For the character to survive, they must
be treated within an hour of injury; beyond that, only the most powerful
of spells has a chance to bring the character back to life. If the
victim receives no treatment from a character with at least Medicine-1
within an hour of injury, the character dies.

The healer throws 2D + the healer's Medicine skill and consults the
following table with the result. Note that a "natural" throw of 2 always
means death, and a "natural" throw of 12 always means a normal recovery.

**Mortal wounds**

| **2D** | **Result**                  |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| 7-     | Death                       |
| 8      | Significant internal damage |
| 9-11   | Radical measures required   |
| 12+    | Normal recovery             |

DM-2 if wounded by an explosion.

DM-2 if the patient has original END 5-.

DM+2 if the patient has original END 10+.

DM+1 if the **respite** spell was used, DM+2 if the **convalescence**
spell was used.

**Death:** the character dies. Only powerful magic can bring the
character back to life – usually at a price.

**Significant internal damage:** multiple internal organs mangled.
Permanently subtract 1D from each physical characteristic. If any of
them reaches zero or less from this roll, the character dies.

**Radical measures required:** throw 1D:

*1:* internal organ removed. Permanently reduce one physical
characteristic by 1D. Character dies if it reaches zero or less.

*2-3:* leg amputated. Movement halved (given a crutch) and the character
may either act or move during a given round, but not both.

*4-5:* arm amputated. The character obviously cannot use that arm for
any purpose.

*6:* eye removed. DM-1 to all actions requiring two eyes, including all
ranged attack throws.

**Normal recovery:** heal as normal for a seriously wounded character.
At the Referee's discretion, the near-death experience may have had a
certain permanent effect on the character, such as a vicious scar or
several missing teeth – or even a missing finger.

Note that certain high-level spells may be able to cure such wounds,
though powerful magic brings with it certain risks.

### Natural Healing

An injured character regains a number of characteristic points equal to
his 1D6 + Endurance DM per day of full rest. If the character continues
an active lifestyle he only heals a number of characteristic points
equal to 1 + Endurance DM per day. Characters with a low Endurance DM
(quite possibly from injury) may degrade (lose more characteristic
points) over time if they are unlucky or cannot (or will not) rest.

A seriously wounded character only regains characteristic points equal
to his Endurance DM per day of rest, which means that the character may
never heal naturally and will even get worse if his Endurance DM is
currently negative.

### Medical Treatment 

Natural healing is not the only way to recover damage. Characters can
also seek out medical treatment.

**First Aid**: Applying first aid restores a number of characteristic
points equal to twice the Effect of the Medic check. Points restored by
first aid are divided as desired among all damaged physical
characteristics. First aid must be applied within five minutes of the
injuries being received to be fully effective. A character can still
benefit from first aid up to an hour after their injury but they only
receive a number of characteristic points equal to the Effect of the
Medic check. Performing first aid on yourself is a Difficult (–2) task.

**Surgery**: A character that is seriously wounded (after first aid has
been applied) requires surgery. Surgery restores characteristic points
just like first aid but if the check is failed the patient loses
characteristic points equal to the Effect. Surgery requires a hospital
or sickbay. Once one characteristic is back to its maximum level the
patient can benefit from medical care. Surgery does not benefit
characters that are not seriously wounded. Performing surgery on
yourself is a Very Difficult (–4) task.

**Medical Care**: Medical care restores 2 + the character's Endurance
DM + the doctor's Medic skill in characteristic points per day, divided
evenly among all damaged characteristics. Medical care requires a
hospital or sickbay and for the patient to undergo full bed rest.

### Healing and Mental Characteristics

Other than Psionic Strength, characters may also suffer damage to their
Intelligence or even their Education. Unless otherwise specified, each
mental characteristic heals at the rate of one point per day.

## Morale

While player characters can always choose when to fight and when to
retreat, the Referee determines when NPCs and monsters surrender or
retreat from combat. NPCs fighting on the PCs' side, such as retainers,
also use the Morale rules. All monsters, as well as mercenaries and
retainers, have a Morale DM, which represents how likely they are to
fight or flee under duress during an encounter. Most mercenaries are at
Morale DM+0; they will fight valiantly under normal conditions but will
often avoid fighting to death and retreat from combat if outmatched. A
coward will have Morale DM-2 or worse; loyal retainers can have Morale
DM+2 or better,

The Referee usually makes a morale throw for each NPC or monster (or
group of NPCs or monsters, for larger fights) in one of two cases: when
the NPC's side in the encounter has taken a casualty, or when half of
the group is killed or incapacitated. If both occur on the same round,
make a morale throw at a further DM-2.

When checking morale, throw 2D with the above-mentioned DMs and consult
the following table:

**NPC and monster morale**

| **2D** | **Result**          |
|--------|---------------------|
| 5-     | Retreat             |
| 6-8    | Fighting withdrawal |
| 9-11   | Keep fighting       |
| 12-15  | Advance             |
| 16+    | Fight to the death  |

**Retreat:** the NPC will run away from the enemy, using both actions in
their next round to run. If running is not possible, the NPC will throw
down any weapons and surrender, begging for mercy.

**Fighting withdrawal:** the NPC will use one action in their next round
to move away from the characters, but will use the second action for
Overwatch, or, if pursued, to attack.

The NPC will continue to retreat or withdraw until they are no longer
pursued by enemies. If there is no way to escape, the NPC will attempt
to surrender, and will fight only as a last resort – when their
surrender is not accepted and the enemy presses on with fighting.

**Keep fighting:** the NPC will continue fighting but will not pursue if
the opponent flees.

**Advance:** the NPC will continue to fight and will pursue withdrawing
or retreating foes.

**Fight to the death:** the NPC will keep fighting and will be immune
from any further Morale throws in this battle.

## Vehicles in Personal Combat

Combat in and on vehicles is much the same as ordinary combat. The
differences are as follows:

- Unlike people, who are mobile and maneuverable, careful track must be
  kept of which way a vehicle is facing. Vehicle-mounted weapons – and
  armed passengers, to a lesser extent – are restricted to certain fire
  arcs.

- Vehicles are considered to move on the driver's Initiative. The driver
  must spend a minor action every round to keep control of the vehicle
  under normal circumstances – a straight road or simple maneuvers – or
  a significant action to navigate obstacles, conduct evasion or
  pursuit, or dodge incoming fire.

- Attackers gain a +1 DM to hit most vehicles because of their size.

### Closed and Open Vehicles

There are two main types of vehicles: open and closed.

**Closed Vehicles**: Closed vehicles grant cover to the occupants –
unless the description mentions otherwise civilian vehicles grant ½ soft
cover and military vehicles full hard cover. Only a few people in a
closed vehicle can shoot out, depending on the number of windows or
other firing ports and the internal space available. Unless the
description mentions otherwise up to two people can fire into each arc
from a civilian vehicle and one person in each arc in a military one.

**Open Vehicles**: Open vehicles grant no cover to the passengers. Any
passenger in an open vehicle can shoot (or otherwise attack) in any
direction.

### Chases

The tactical combat rules represent action in small, more limited areas.
For vehicles, this means short ranges and slow speeds. However, a
fast-moving vehicle, such as a chariot being pulled by a team of
galloping horses, will quickly pass through the entire combat area in
one or two combat rounds. This is unsuitable for chases. Use these rules
instead. They are designed to be highly descriptive in their approach to
vehicle combat. It will be up to the Referee and the players to describe
how the action unfolds as the participants maneuver, jockey for
position, and attack each other.

Chase turns are an abstraction in combat and vary in length depending on
circumstances, from mere combat rounds in a foot-chase to long minutes
in long drawn-out naval duels. The Referee should inform the players of
how long each chase combat turn is at the start of the chase.

There is no initiative throw in chases; one party is always the Pursuer
and the other is the Target. Instead, at the start of each turn both
participants throw 2D + the relevant vehicle skill + the vehicle's
Agility. The Pursuer wins on ties. The winner has Advantage and may
attack using the regular vehicle attack and damage rules, with the
following modifiers based on the vehicle throw's effect:

**Chase attack DMs**

| **Effect** | **DM** |
|------------|--------|
| 0          | DM-2   |
| 1 or 2     | DM-1   |
| 3 or 4     | DM+0   |
| 5+         | DM+1   |

The loser of the Advantage throw cannot attack in that turn. Note that
there is no tracking of range in a chase. This is intentional. The
attack penalty for low-Effect Advantage rolls is meant to reflect a bad
angle of attack, or sub-optimal range for an attack, among other things.

It is possible to have multiple parties engaged in a chase. Simply
record the different Advantage results in descending order. The vehicles
higher on the “ladder” may attack any vehicle below them. This can be
used to great effect in a multi-party chase, or even an aerial combat
between multiple griffin-riders (for example).

Chases last five turns. At the end of the fifth turn, if the Target has
not been stopped, disabled, or destroyed, the Target escapes and the
chase ends.

### Skirmishing and Jousting

In a skirmish, two or more highly maneuverable vehicles, such as fast
galleys – or mounted knights on horseback - try to outmaneuver and fight
each other. A skirmish has no time limit, barring rower fatigue
considerations. The skirmish ends either when one participant is
disabled or destroyed, or if one participant disengages. To disengage
from a skirmish, a participant must have Advantage and use their action
that turn to throw Vehicle Skill (usually Watercraft) 10+, including the
DM for the vehicle’s Agility.

### Foot or Horseback Chases

Chases on foot or on horseback use similar rules. Each turn, each side
throws Athletics + DEX DM. In a mounted chase, throw the Riding skill +
the mount's DEX DM. The pursuer wins on ties. The winner of this opposed
throw may attack in melee or ranged combat, at the Referee's discretion,
while the loser cannot attack in that turn. Foot chases end in the same
way that other chases end, that is, either when the pursuer subdues the
pursuits or gives up the chase, or after five turns, in which the
pursued escapes. Referees should track the number of turns to ensure
that Fatigue effects are considered.

### Vehicle-Mounted Weapons 

Weapons mounted on vehicles are limited in what directions they can
fire. A weapon mounted in the front arc, for example, can only fire into
a 90˚ area in front of the vehicle. Weapons in turrets can fire in any
direction.

### Collisions 

When a vehicle collides with something else everything takes damage.
Roll 1D6 for every 10 kph of the vehicle's speed (round up). This is
applied as damage directly to anything hit and, if the thing struck is
solid enough, also to the ramming vehicle. Any unsecured passengers in a
vehicle damaged in a collision take the same damage and, if possible,
are thrown three meters for every 10 kph of speed. Secured passengers
(those wearing seatbelts or something similar) are not thrown anywhere
and take one quarter damage.

### Vehicular Actions 

These are all significant actions that the driver of a vehicle can take
when his turn in the initiative order arrives.

#### Evasive Action 

Vehicles are not typically maneuverable enough to dodge as a reaction.
Instead, the driver may declare that he is taking evasive action when
his turn arrives. He makes a skill check (skill determined by vehicle)
and the Effect acts as a –DM to all attacks against the vehicle or its
passengers. The Effect also acts as a –DM to any attacks made from the
vehicle as well. This lasts until the driver's next action.

#### Maneuvering 

A driver or pilot can maneuver his vehicle without making a skill check.
This allows the vehicle to avoid large or obvious obstacles, to get
where it is going, to move out of one fire arc of an enemy vehicle and
into a different one, or to change the fire arc that a single target is
in.

#### Ram 

Deliberately driving a vehicle into someone or something requires a
significant action and a successful skill check (skill determined by
vehicle). Rams are affected by dodging and evasive action as normal. The
Referee may grant bonuses to a ram attempt or declare it automatically
successful if the target is particularly large.

#### Stunt 

With a significant action and a successful vehicle control check the
driver or pilot of a vehicle can do pretty much anything it is possible
to do in his vehicle – stand a car up on two wheels, perform stunning
aerobatics in a jet plane, or skim a speedboat over a low sandbar. A
stunt can be used to put a single target into one additional fire arc
for one round, to set up some other skill check using the rules for task
chains, to achieve something that would normally be difficult or
impossible in your vehicle, to achieve up to three maneuver actions in
one go, just to show off, or anything else you can imagine.

#### Weave 

In an environment with many obstacles, such as an inner city or tight
underground caverns, a driver or pilot may choose to weave his vehicle
in and around the obstacles at high speed in order to evade pursuit. The
driver chooses a weaving number, as low as one or as high as one per 20
km/h of speed (round up), and must then make a skill check (skill
determined by vehicle) with the weaving number as a penalty on his roll.
If he fails, he has woven into an obstacle and crashed. If he succeeds,
any pursuers must choose a weave action on their turn and make their
skill test at the same penalty with the same consequence for failure.
Alternatively, they can choose to break off pursuit and either give up
or try to reacquire the target later.

### Fire and Wooden Ships

In naval combat using wooden ships, fire is a particularly potent
hazard. A penetrating hit by a flaming weapon, such as a catapult's
pitch shot or a dragon's breath, will ignite a fire. This fire causes
one damage "hit" throw and will cause an additional damage "hit" roll
every round afterward until the fire is put out. The more hits the fire
causes to the ship, the greater the blaze, and the harder the fire will
be to extinguish. Fighting fires requires one person per damage "hit"
caused by the fire. The firefighter must dedicate the full chase turn to
fighting the fire. Each damage “hit” requires a crewmember dedicated to
firefighting before the Referee allows a roll of 8+ to extinguish the
entire blaze.

### Vehicle Damage 

Vehicles have a Hull value and a Structure value, which measure the
vehicle's structural integrity. When Hull is reduced to 0, the vehicle
starts taking damage to its internal systems. When Structure is reduced
to 0, the vehicle is reduced to scrap. Vehicles also suffer damage to
onboard systems as they take damage.

To determine the effects of an attack on a vehicle, first determine how
much damage the vehicle suffers as normal. Many vehicles will have one
or more points of armor that reduces the damage. Consult the Vehicle
Damage table to determine how many ‘hits' the vehicle suffers. Each hit
is then applied to a particular location on the vehicle. Double or
Triple hits count as two or three hits on the same location.

#### Table: Vehicle Damage

| Damage                       | Effect                             |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 0 or less                    | No damage                          |

| 31–33                        | Two Triple Hits                    |
| For every extra three points | +1 Single Hit                      |
| For every extra six points   | +1 Double Hit                      |

#### Hull 

Reduce the vehicle or drone's Hull by one. If a vehicle runs out of
Hull, further Hull hits become hits on the same row of the Internal
Damage table (if a vehicle) or Structure hits (if a robot or drone).

#### Structure 

Reduce the vehicle or drone's Structure by one. If a vehicle runs out of
Structure, it is destroyed. If the vehicle is destroyed by an attack
that reduces it to a negative Structure score it explodes, doing 4D6
damage to everyone within six meters (including the occupants) and 2D6
damage to everyone within twelve meters. The occupants of a closed
vehicle cannot dodge or dive for cover from this explosion but the
occupants of an open vehicle can.

#### Armor 

Reduce the vehicle's armor by one.

#### Critical

Massive internal damage. Roll on the Critical Damage table instead.

#### Drive 

**First Hit**: Reduce movement by 10% and apply a –1 DM to all vehicle
control skill checks.

**Second Hit**: Reduce movement by 25% and apply a –2 DM to all vehicle
control skill checks.

**Third Hit**: Drive disabled.

Further drive hits count as Hull hits.

#### Weapon 

Choose a weapon or device randomly for each hit.

**First Hit**: The weapon or device suffers a –2 DM to all checks
related to its operation.

**Second Hit**: The weapon or device is destroyed.

If no weapons remain to be destroyed, further hits on this location
become Hull hits.

#### Sensors 

**First Hit**: The vehicle or drone suffers a –2 DM to all Comms checks
to use sensors. For drones and robots, this also applies to Recon
checks.

**Second Hit**: The sensors are destroyed, blinding the vehicle or
drone.

Further Sensor hits count as Hull hits.

#### Locomotion 

The vehicle's sails or oars are damaged.

**First Hit***:* halve the vehicle's speed.

**Second hit:** The vehicle's sails are torn, or oars are all broken,
and it cannot move. In case of flying super-tech vehicles, this might
cause a crash; throw Science 6+ to land safely, otherwise the vehicle
crashes; roll on the Low Tech Critical Damage table.

#### Power Plant 

**First Hit**: The vehicle or drone loses one round's worth of actions.

**Second Hit**: The vehicle or drone's movement is reduced by 50%.

**Third Hit**: The power plant is destroyed, disabling the vehicle and
inflicting 1D6 Hull hits on it.

#### Limb 

Choose a limb randomly for each limb hit.

**First Hit**: The limb suffers a –2 DM to all checks related to its
operation.

**Second Hit**: The limb is destroyed.

Further Limb hits count as Hull hits.

#### Passengers

Choose a passenger randomly for this hit. The passenger takes damage
equal to the damage inflicted on the vehicle. This is reduced by
personal armor, if applicable. If all the passengers are dead, further
passenger hits become Structure hits.

#### Crew

Choose a crew randomly for this hit. The passenger takes damage equal to
the damage inflicted on the vehicle. This is reduced by personal armor,
if applicable. If all the passengers are dead, further passenger hits
become Structure hits.

#### Cargo 

1 ton of cargo is destroyed. If no cargo remains, further cargo hits
become Structure hits.

#### Cockpit 

The pilot of the vehicle is hit, and takes damage equal to the damage
inflicted on the vehicle. This is reduced by personal armor, if
applicable. If the pilot is dead, further pilot hits become Structure
hits.

#### Computer 

**First Hit**: The vehicle's computer system is disabled. A drone or
robot with a disabled computer system shuts down for 1D6 rounds.

**Second Hit**: The vehicle's computer system is destroyed. A drone or
robot with no computer system is completely disabled.

Further Computer hits count as Structure hits.

### Repairs 

Damage to a vehicle or drone falls into three categories – System
Damage, Hull Damage, and Structure Damage.

**System Damage**: A damaged system can be jury-rigged back to
functioning, but it will stop functioning again after 1D6 hours.
Repairing a damaged system requires not only an Average skill check
(using the appropriate skill as determined by the Referee, such as
Electronics, Engineering, Gravitics, Mechanics) taking 1–6 hours but
also a source of spare parts. The spare parts can come from a scrap
yard, a workshop, systems on another vehicle, or can be taken from other
systems on the same vehicle. When taking spare parts from other vehicle
systems, each ‘hit' of damage provides enough spare parts to make a
single repair check.

The Passengers and Cockpit systems cannot take hits to provide spare
parts, although cybernetic parts might be able to provide enough spare
material to repair minor damage.

A destroyed system costs 2D6x10% of its original cost to repair, and
cannot be repaired using spare parts. It requires a full workshop and
specialist materials.

**Hull Damage**: Hull damage can be repaired with a Mechanics check
taking 1–6 hours and consumes one ‘hit' of spare parts.

**Structure Damage**: Structure damage can only be repaired in a
workshop and requires 10–60 hours per point of damage. It costs 20% of
the base cost of the vehicle per point repaired. No skill check is
required.

## Ground Force Weaponry against Starship-scale Targets

Gaining a DM +4 bonus to hit anything on the starship-scale, ground
force weaponry must divide its damage by 50 before comparing it to a
starship-scale target’s armor. Because a single weapon will, obviously,
be unable to punch though armor it is possible for multiple weapons to
all target the starship simultaneously, and the cumulative effect can
inflict damage. Every additional ground weapon beyond the first can add
half its damage dice to the total before dividing the total by 50 in
order to calculate damage.

# BOOK TWO: STARSHIPS AND INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL

# CHAPTER 6: OFF-WORLD TRAVEL

Characters in science fiction don't live in a single village on a single
planet all their lives. Instead, their stories often take them out of a
planet-bound existence and out into the stars. Adventurers in Märchen
Engine games are no different. They will travel to different worlds,
seeking out new, exciting and hopefully profitable activities to pursue.
Therefore, it is important to develop an understanding of off-world
travel. Off-world travel can take one of two different forms,
interplanetary travel through normal space and interstellar travel
through Jump space. This chapter explores both facets.

## Interplanetary Travel

All ship operations, including interstellar flights, involve some
sublight maneuvering. Ships making short interplanetary flights usually
accelerate halfway there, then reverse thrust and decelerate the rest of
the way. The Common Travel Times by Acceleration table offers rounded
values for common travel times.

For Referees desiring more accuracy in their numbers, use the formula:

**T=2** $\sqrt{\frac{\mathbf{D}}{\mathbf{A}}}$ where **T** is time in
seconds, **D** is distance in meters, and **A** is acceleration in
m/sec<sup>2</sup>

## Interstellar Travel

Interstellar flights require the use of Jump drive. Jump is also often
used for long-distance flights within a solar system, where the
real-space transit time would be greater than the 1-week Jump time. A
ship can only safely Jump when it is more than one hundred diameters
distant from any object. Gravity can cause a Jump bubble to collapse
prematurely, bringing a ship back into normal space early. To enter
Jump, a vessel needs a properly aligned hull Jump grid, a suitable set
of course vectors (called a Jump Plot), and a working and properly
fueled Jump drive.

The Jump grid allows the Jump field to properly form around the ship and
protect it from Jump space. A damaged or misaligned grid can cause a
ship to misjump, or to suffer Jump Intrusions while in Jump space. In
the worst-case scenario, a ship with a damaged drive or a distorted grid
may be destroyed at entry or breakout.

A Jump Plot is also required. A Jump Plot can be created by a navigator
using the ship’s computer. In addition, all Class-D and better starports
can provide pre-calculated jump plots for any populated worlds within
jump range for ₢1,000 per jump number. Each jump course tape provides
the jump plot necessary to perform a jump from one specific world to a
specific destination, and become increasingly less reliable as they get
older.

Creating a Jump Plot is an Easy (+4) Education-based Navigation skill
check taking 1D6 kiloseconds, modified by the Jump distance (thus, a
Jump–4 gives a –4 DM to the check). If the check is failed, then the
navigator must plot the Jump again, or the starship suffers a misjump. A
Jump cannot be made until the navigation calculations are complete. Jump
Plots can be created in advance, but quickly become out of date.

When the ship is ready to Jump, the engineer must properly divert power
to the Jump drive. Firing the Jump drive is an Average (+0)
Education-based Engineer check taking 10–60 seconds. The Effect of this
check aids the Jump Success roll.

All normal Jumps take roughly one week (148+6D6 hours), and are subject
to random variations in the point of emergence. The older a plot is, the
more variance there is in the actual Jump performance. Thus course tapes
tend to err on the side of caution, and give emergence points a long way
out from the destination world.

A Jump carries the vessel a number of parsecs equal to the Jump number.
Jumps of less than one parsec (less than three light years, or one hex)
are possible, and count as Jump–1 for the purposes of navigation and
fuel expenditure.

### Jump Success Roll

Roll 2D6 and add the following DMs. If the result is 0 or less, the ship
misjumps. If the result is 8+ the Jump is accurate. Any other result is
an inaccurate Jump. If a Jump was made using a bad Jump Plot, the ship
automatically misjumps.

\+ the Effect of the divert power Engineer check

–1 per month that the Jump Plot is out of date (such as when using older
Jump course tapes)

–2 per Jump drive hit

–2 for using Unrefined fuel

–8 if still within the hundred-diameter limit at the time of Jump

### Jump Failures and Misjumps

When a starship suffers an inaccurate Jump, the vessel emerges from Jump
in the wrong part of the target star system, requiring 1D6 days travel
through normal space. When a starship misjumps, the ship ends up 1D6x1D6
parsecs in a random direction.

In both cases, the emergence is extremely hard. The vessel takes the
equivalent of a critical hit from the discordant transition. In
addition, everyone aboard the vessel suffers severe headaches, nausea
and even nosebleeds for several hours before and after the ship emerges
from Jump space.

## Starship Operations

Standard procedures exist to govern how a starship goes about its
business and handles emergency situations. Under normal circumstances, a
ship will not deviate from these procedures. A captain whose vessel
ignores standard operating procedure will usually have to explain
himself to a patrol vessel or the local port authority.

### Ship’s Passage

A ship must provide sufficient accommodation for its crew; normally this
means one stateroom per two crewmembers (this is termed
double-occupancy). Any remaining stateroom space may be used to carry
passengers. Passengers cannot share accommodation with crew, with the
exception of working passage. Normally, one passenger per small
stateroom and two per large stateroom room can be carried.

Passenger travel can be classified into five overarching categories –
high, middle, low, working and stowaway.

**High Passage**: The best method of travel is called high passage,
which involves first class accommodations and cuisine. High passengers
have the services of the ship's steward, entertainment and complete
attention to their comfort. There is a baggage allowance of up to 1,000
kilograms. High passage costs ₢10,000 and provides food and lodging for
1 person for a distance of 1 jump. Double occupancy is allowed at a
discounted rate of ₢16,000 (₢8000 per passenger). Each level of Steward
skill (including level 0) allows the steward to effectively look after
two high passage passengers on board a ship (so a character with Steward
2 could care for six passengers).

**Middle Passage**: In order for starships to fill their staterooms with
passengers, middle passage is offered on a standby basis, in the event
that not enough high passages are sold. While middle passengers occupy
staterooms normally similar to those occupied by high passengers, they
do not receive the service or entertainment accorded the higher paying
passengers. In addition, the quality of the cuisine is rather low.
Baggage totaling 100 kilograms is allowed. A middle passenger may be
'bumped' and the stateroom taken by a late arriving high passenger; the
middle passenger's ticket is returned, but no other compensation is
made. (The middle could then buy a high passage and 'bump' another
middle passenger, if the extra cost seemed worth it. Middle passage
costs ₢8,000 and provides food and lodging for 1 person for a distance
of 1 jump. Double occupancy is allowed at a discounted rate of ₢13,000
(₢6500 per passenger). Each level of the Steward skill (including level
0) allows the steward to care for five middle passengers.

**Low Passage**: Transportation while in cold sleep (suspended
animation) is possible at relatively low cost to the passenger. The
passenger is placed in a low passage berth before the ship takes off,
and travels the entire journey in a state of suspended animation. He
does not age, and requires very little life support. Unfortunately, the
low passage system involves some intrinsic dangers to the passenger, and
he runs some risk of not surviving the voyage. Therefore a qualified
medic should always be in attendance when reviving passengers from low
berths. When a passenger is revived from cold sleep, they must make an
Easy (+4) Endurance check; failure means that the passenger dies during
revival. If a medic is present, the medic may assist the passenger with
an Education-based Routine (+2) Medicine skill check, as per the Aid
Another rules. Low passage costs ₢1,000 and includes a 10 kg baggage
allowance; many commercial cryoberth units have a built-in baggage
compartment.

**Working Passage**: A starship captain with a crew shortage may hire an
individual to fill the vacant position, paying not money but passage in
return. Working passage may not continue for more than three jumps, or
the individual is considered to have been hired for standard salary. In
order to be hired for working passage, the individual must have some
expertise in the position for which he is hired. Baggage totaling 1,000
kilograms is allowed.

**Stowaway**: A stowaway is a person who secretly boards a vessel in
order to travel without paying and without being detected. Unnoticed by
the captain, crew, port officials and customs authorities, stowaways may
gain access to a vessel with or without the assistance of port
personnel. Once on board the ship, stowaways often hide in empty
containers, cargo holds, maintenance shafts, crawl spaces, storage
rooms, engine rooms, unused staterooms, and behind false panels.
Stowaways risk imprisonment or heavy fines if caught, as it is
considered a crime in most jurisdictions. If caught at the destination
world, stowaways may be deported. Should this occur, the travel costs
for the stowaway's return to the previous world visited, per the ship's
logs, can become the obligation of the ship's owner or captain. Because
of this, most commanders do not take kindly to any stowaways they
discover aboard their vessels, and have been known to space them.

### Standard Operating Procedures

Most commercial starships follow a simple schedule, spending one week in
Jump space and one week in normal space, taking care of business. Once a
ship emerges from Jump space, it travels to the destination world, where
passengers disembark, old cargo is unloaded and new cargo replaces it,
the crew performs routine ship maintenance and refueling, new passengers
come aboard the vessel, and then the starship travels to a Jump point in
preparation for entering Jump space and traveling to the ship’s next
destination.

Non-commercial starships typically follow a similar schedule. Without
the obligations of passengers or cargo, however, these vessels can
choose to travel much faster. The week in-system can be reduced to
simply refueling by the quickest means possible and then making the next
Jump.

When a vessel first emerges from Jump space, the first course of action
is to scan normal space for potential dangers. Once the commander
determines that the vessel is safe, the navigator then determines the
ship's location in normal Space and plots a course to the ship's
destination in-system.

The commander may want to skim a local gas giant for free fuel. If so,
the pilot achieves orbit and skims the "surface" of the gas giant for
fuel. Scooping a gas giant for fuel takes 1D6 hours per 40 tons of fuel.
When the fuel tanks are full, the pilot can then take the ship back out
to a Jump point to leave for the next system, or travel to another
destination in-system, such as a local world.

If the commander wishes to visit a local world, such as the mainworld,
the pilot follows a course laid out by the navigator to the destination.
After arriving at the world, the pilot achieves orbit and then proceeds
to either the orbital starport or surface starport. Once docked at the
starport, the vessel unloads any high passengers, followed by mail,
middle passengers, cargo and finally low passengers. The ship refuels,
if needed, and renews its life support. If the ship’s owner or captain
is interested in speculative trading, they then sell off speculative
cargo and buy new cargo to replace it, if they find any good deals. In
addition, the commander or purser addresses all ship's business,
including paying the ship expenses.

While on planet, crew members may explore local areas of interest, hire
new crew to fill any available positions, and even take on the
occasional odd job.

When the commander determines it is time to depart, cargo handlers load
all cargo into the vessel. Low passengers are then put into cryoberths.
High passengers are then escorted to their staterooms, followed by mid
passengers, if any staterooms remain available. Finally, vessels with a
mail contract load up on outgoing mail. Income is collected and placed
into the ship's accounts.

After getting clearance from starport control, the pilot takes the ship
into orbit. The navigator then plots a course through normal space to a
Jump point. As the pilot takes the vessel to the Jump point, the
navigator works out the Jump plot. Once at the Jump point, the engineer
diverts power to the Jump drive, and the ship enters Jump space.

Along the way, the vessel may encounter other ships. Gas giants are
often used by pirates to attack unsuspecting vehicles, so system defense
boats are prevalent in the region. Patrol vessels may hail a ship as it
travels to and from the Jump point. Port authorities may perform a
customs inspection before allowing a ship to dock at the starport. Other
ships, civilian and military, commercial and non-commercial, may be
travelling in and out of the system.

## Starship Expenses

The primary expenses for a starship are the ship’s mortgage or debts,
crew salaries, fuel, life support, port fees and routine maintenance.

### Mortgage or Debts

If the crew is paying off debts on their spacecraft, then these debts
must be paid each month. The standard terms for a ship mortgage are
paying 1/240th of the cash price each month for 480 months (40 years).
In effect, interest and bank financing cost a simple 120% of the final
cost of the ship, and the total financed price equals 220% of the cash
purchase price. Ship shares are treated as reducing the cash price of
the ship, and so reduce the monthly cash payments.

### Crew Salaries

All starships and space vessels need a crew of some kind. Small craft
like shuttles normally just have a pilot (and usually a copilot). Larger
ships, and especially those using Jump drive to travel between the
stars, need a larger crew. At a minimum, a starship will need:

**Pilot**: A qualified Pilot to maneuver the ship. A Pilot makes ₢6,000
per month.

**Navigator**: Someone to create Jump Plots and navigate the ship. On
small ships, this job is often doubled up with the Pilot’s duties. A
Navigator makes ₢5,000 per month.

**Engineer**: Someone to maintain the ship and operate the drives.
Larger ships may need several engineers and technicians to back them up.
A Chief Engineer makes ₢4,000 per month.

Other crew positions exist:

**Master**: A vessel’s Master, or Captain, is responsible for the vessel
and the safety of everyone aboard. A Merchant who receives the Starship
benefit at mustering-out will hold this position. Aboard a small ship,
he will usually have another job, such as Pilot or Navigator. The pay
due to a ship’s Master can vary. Assume a standard of ₢6,000 per month,
or the salary of highest-paid job he is qualified to do. Many merchant
ship owners take a cut of the ship’s profits instead of a salary.

**Medic**: Ships that carry passengers must have a qualified medic. All
vessels should have some form of medical assistance available. A medic
makes ₢2,000 a month.

**Purser**: Commercial ships often employ someone to look after the
accounts and supplies. This is the purser’s job. It is often doubled-up
with other duties. A purser is often paid a cut of the ship’s profits
rather than a salary; a standard salary would be ₢3,000 per month.

**Gunner**: Armed ships must employ gunners to operate the weapons.
Salary is ₢1,000 per month.

**Assistant Engineers and Technicians**: Technically adept people can
assist the Engineer in maintaining the ship and operating her drives.
Salary is ₢1000 per month.

**Cargo Handlers, Deck Hands and Security**: Some ships employ personnel
to carry out these duties. While not essential to the operation of the
ship, these people are useful to have around. Salary is ₢1000 per month.

**Stewards**: While anyone can be assigned to look after the passengers
and cook everyone’s meals, professional stewards are useful in ensuring
the passengers enjoy their trip, and thus that the ship stays in
business. Salary is ₢3,000 per month.

The basic living expenses of crewmembers during their shipboard duties
are considered paid out of the ship’s overheads. Note that salaries are
generalized and can vary considerably depending upon circumstances and
special arrangements.

#### Table: Crew Salaries

| Position         | Monthly Salary   |
|------------------|------------------|
| Ship's Master    | Varies           |
| Ship's Purser    | Varies or ₢3,000 |
| Pilot            | ₢6,000           |
| Navigator        | ₢5,000           |
| Engineer         | ₢4,000           |
| Steward          | ₢3,000           |
| Medic            | ₢2,000           |
| Gunner           | ₢1,000           |
| Other Crewmember | ₢1,000           |

### Fuel

Refined fuel may be purchased at any class A or B starport for ₢500 per
ton delivered at the starport. If fuel must be ferried out to a ship,
add ₢100 per ton to the cost. Refined fuel may also be obtained by
running unrefined fuel through a Fuel Purification System installed
onboard a ship. Refined fuel decreases the chance of a problem occurring
with a ship's power plant, maneuver drive, and Jump drive.

Unrefined fuel is available for ₢100 per ton from any class A, B, or C
starport delivered at the starport. If fuel must be ferried out to a
ship, add ₢100 per ton to the cost. Unrefined fuel is also available for
free from the following sources:

**Water**: On worlds with a hydrographic rating of 1 or higher, a ship
may land near an open body of water or ice and pump fuel into their fuel
tanks for free. Using water as fuel in this manner is considered to be
running unrefined fuel. Note that many worlds may not allow ships to
land and fuel for free, preferring to control the availability of fuel
from the starport only, thus earning the revenue from the operation.

**Gas Giants**: Streamlined ships equipped with fuel scoops may dive
into the upper atmosphere of a gas giant and fill their tanks with
unrefined hydrogen. Larger ships may use streamlined fuel shuttles to
ferry fuel loads back to the main ship as needed to refill the tanks.
Scooping takes 1D6 hours per 40 tons of fuel. There are no fees
associated with 'skimming' a gas giant for fuel, but these are also
often the favorite point of attack for pirates. Fuel skimmed from a gas
giant is considered to be unrefined.

### Life Support

Each stateroom on a ship costs ₢2,000 per month, occupied or not. This
cost covers supplies for the life support system as well as food and
water, although meals at this level will be rather spartan. Each low
passage berth costs ₢100 per month.

A spacecraft with power can sustain life support for one person per
stateroom for one month comfortably, and for six months at a stretch
(number of staterooms × 5,000 person/hours). Without power, this drops
to two weeks at most.

Life support supplies can be purchased in bulk. One ton of life support
supplies will provide 20 passengers or crew with life support for one
month, at a cost of ₢54,000. One ton of luxury life support supplies
costs ₢72,000, and covers the same number of people for the same amount
of time.

### Port Fees

It typically costs ₢100 to berth for 6 days in a starport, and ₢100 a
day thereafter.

### Routine Maintenance

A ship needs maintenance, which costs 0.1% (1/1000th) of the total cost
of the ship per year and requires a shipyard. Maintenance should be
carried out each month. If maintenance is skipped or skimped on, roll
2D6 each month, with a +DM equal to the number of months skipped. On an
8+, the ship takes damage to a random system. Roll on the System
Degradation table for the number of hits. Repair supplies cost
₢10,000/ton.

#### Table: System Degradation

| Roll | Number of Hits |
|------|----------------|
| 1–3  | 1              |
| 4–5  | 2              |
| 6    | 3              |

## Starship Revenue

Starships generate revenue by carrying passengers, cargo, mail and
charters. Goods taken on in orbit are delivered when placed in orbit
around the destination. Goods taken on a planetary surface are
considered to be delivered when off-loaded on the surface of the
destination world. This custom applies to cargo, passengers, and mail.

#### Table: Available Freight And Passengers

| Starport Class | Freight (tons) | High Passengers | Mid Passengers | Low Passengers |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| A              | 3D6x10         | 3D6             | 3D6            | 3D6 X3         |
| B              | 3D6x5          | 2D6             | 3D6            | 3D6 X3         |
| C              | 3D6x2          | 1D6-1           | 2D6            | 3D6            |
| D              | 3D6            | 0               | 1D6-1          | 2D6            |
| E              | 1D6            | 0               | 1d3-1          | 1D6-1          |
| X              | No Freight     | 0               | 0              | 0              |

### Bulk Cargo

Ships will commonly pay their way by transporting cargo in bulk. This is
on a flat-fee basis per ton of cargo. A ship's accounts are credited
with ₢1,000 per ton of cargo, upon delivery. For any given destination
world, roll on the Available Freight and Passengers table to find out
how many tons of freight are available. A ship may choose to remain in
port and see if new cargoes present themselves; roll again every 3 days.
If desired, players may determine how much freight there is for every
destination, and then choose where to go based upon profitability. The
number of passengers must be determined at the same time as cargo; if a
ship remains in port waiting for freight, passengers will find another
ship, and vice versa.

A ship without the capacity to carry all the available freight or
passengers can take some of what is available, up to its total capacity.

### Passengers

For any given destination world, roll on the Available Freight and
Passengers table to find out how many passengers are available. A ship
may choose to remain in port and see if new passengers present
themselves; roll again every 3 days. If desired, players may determine
how many passengers there are for every destination, and then choose
where to go based upon profitability. The number of passengers must be
determined at the same time as cargo; if a ship remains in port waiting
for more passengers, freight could be shipped out on another ship, and
vice versa.

### Mail and Incidentals

Merchant ships may receive mail delivery contracts, usually as an
adjunct to their established routes. Five tons of ship cargo capacity
must be committed to postal duty on a full time basis, the ship must be
armed, and a gunner must be a part of the crew. The starship is paid
₢25,000 (₢5,000 per ton of postal cargo area) for each trip made,
regardless of the actual mail tonnage carried. Such tonnage will not
exceed 5 tons per trip. Roll 1D6-1 for the number of actual tons of
mail, though the ship receives the ₢25,000 fee whether there is anything
to carry, or not.

Other ships may be approached to deliver private messages, at times
through the ship's owner or captain, and at times clandestinely through
a crew member. Private mail is usually intended for delivery to a
specific point (such as an Explorer’s Society resort, or to a bar owner
in the starport), and is generally accompanied by a ₢20 to ₢120
honorarium. The Referee should decide if a private message to is
awaiting transmittal, and determine randomly which crew member is
approached to carry it. Serving as a carrier for private mail also
serves as an introduction to the recipient as a dependable, trustworthy
person.

### Charters

Vessels are often chartered by commercial or private concerns. The
reasons vary: private transport, standby cargo capacity for a priority
load, special or "discreet" deliveries, etc. The standard price to
charter a non-starship is ₢1 per ton per hour, usually with a
twelve-hour minimum. Charter price for a starship is computed based on
its capacity. Starships are chartered in 2-week blocks; the charge is
₢900 per ton of cargo hold plus ₢9,000 per high passage berth and ₢900
per low passage berth. The owner pays all overhead and supplies a crew.

### Speculative Trading

A trader with cargo space available and free capital with which to
speculate may seek out suitable goods to buy and sell. A complete Trade
and Commerce system is presented in **Chapter 7: Trade and Commerce**.

## Miscellaneous Topics

The following topics relate to aspects of starship operations that might
impact an adventurer’s experience over the course of a Märchen Engine
adventure or campaign.

### Airlocks

A ship has at least one airlock per 100 tons. The average airlock is
large enough for three people in vacc suits to pass through at the same
time. An airlock takes ten seconds to cycle. Under normal circumstances,
airlocks are locked down from the bridge and require a Very Difficult
(–4) Engineer (electronics) check to override. An unlocked airlock can
be triggered from outside. Airlocks generally have vacc suits, rescue
bubbles and cutlasses in a ship’s locker nearby.

Ships with cargo space have cargo hatches, allowing up to 10% of their
cargo to be transferred at any time.

### Distress Signals

A distress signal indicates that a person or group of people, vessel,
small craft, or other vehicle is threatened by grave and imminent danger
and requests immediate assistance. The use of distress signals under
other circumstances is against most system and interstellar laws; in
fact, most jurisdictions have large penalties for false, unwarranted or
prank distress signals. Given the vastness of interplanetary space, help
is hard to come by. Therefore, most interstellar and interplanetary
governments mandate that the commander or master of any vessel that
detects a distress signal is legally obligated to either respond and
offer assistance or contact the authorities to report the signal.

Some pirates have been known to use false distress signals to lure other
vessels into a trap. This behavior has created significant mistrust of
distress signals among civilian starship commanders, but interstellar
law still requires that assistance be rendered if authorities cannot be
reached within a reasonable time period. In the event that the commander
of a vessel is unable or unwilling to respond to such a call, they are
required by law to officially log their reason for not doing so into the
ship's logs. Such commanders can be held accountable for their decision,
and can pay a fine on some worlds that could exceed ₢1,000,000 (or M₢1),
as well as serve time in prison.

### Docking

Two spacecraft may dock if they are close together and neither ship
attempts to resist the docking maneuver. Many airlock designs across
charted space are compatible; for incompatible airlocks, ships extend
flexible plastic docking tubes that adapt to the target airlock. Docking
with another vessel is a Routine (+2) Pilot task taking 1–6 minutes. If
one ship is drifting or unpowered, the difficulty rises to Difficult
(–2).

### Boarding

Hostile boarding actions are safest when the enemy ship is crippled, in
which case it is a standard docking procedure. If the enemy ship is
still moving, then the prospective boarders must match the target’s
velocity and dock with it (a Difficult (–2) Pilot task), or else just
land on the hull and either make their way to an airlock or cut through
from outside.

### Landing

Any ship with a standard or streamlined hull may land on the surface.
Unstreamlined ships suffer a –2 DM to any Pilot checks made in
atmosphere while a ship with a Distributed hull suffers a –4 DM to any
Pilot checks, and is likely to take severe structural damage if it
lands. Landing at a starport is a Routine (+2) task for most ships
taking 10–60 seconds.

Most ships have landing gear, allowing them to touch down ‘in the wild’,
which requires an Average (+0), Difficult (–2) or even Very Difficult
(–4) check, depending on local conditions. Non-distributed ships can
also land on bodies of water without sinking. Failing a landing roll
means that the ship has landed improperly or even crashed.

## Ship Security

The primary goal of a starship's or vessel's security measures is to
protect the safety of the ship and crew. Particularly on frontier worlds
and lawless backwater planets, starships are at risk to a number of
factors, including hijackers, piracy, sabotage, subversion and
terrorism. Ship security exists on multiple levels to prevent this from
happening. These can be grouped broadly into the categories of physical
security and cybersecurity.

### Physical Security Systems

Physical security systems for vessels are generally intended to deter
potential intruders (e.g. warning signs); detect intrusions and
monitor/record intruders (e.g. intruder alarms and internal monitoring);
and trigger appropriate incident responses (e.g. by security personnel
or the ship's crew in general). Numerous systems have proven useful.

Physical barriers such as airlocks act as the outermost layer of
security. They serve to prevent, or at least delay, attacks, and also
act as a psychological deterrent by making intrusions difficult. Even
within the ship, bulkheads and panels can be locked to limit or slow
access. The means of authorization for different locking systems is
captured in the Restricted Access Security table. It should be noted
that the ship's computer can open or close any non-mechanical lock
remotely, as well as report on a door's status.

Ship security systems can detect intrusion detection through a variety
of means. Cameras, accessible to any authorized personnel, monitor
public areas. Internal sensors such as motion detectors in key traffic
areas and life support detectors (for unexpected changes in oxygen
levels) provide additional methods of detecting intrusion.

#### Table: Restricted Access Security

| Type            | TL  | Means of Access                                | Override Skill | External Door       | Internal Door       |
|-----------------|-----|------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Biometrics      | 8   | DNA test, palm print, retinal scan, voiceprint | Electronics    | Formidable (-6)     | Very Difficult (-4) |
| Electronic Lock | 7   | Keycard or combination                         | Electronics    | Very Difficult (-4) | Difficult (-2)      |
| Intelligent     | 9   | Granted by ship's computer                     | Electronics    | Formidable (-6)     | Very Difficult (-4) |
| Mechanical Lock | 4   | Key or combination                             | Mechanics      | Difficult (-2)      | Average (+0)        |

### Cybersecurity

The security of a ship's computer is only as good as the Security
software that's been installed. All starships come with Security/0
installed, but a wise ship's owner will invest in more advanced security
programs, whenever possible. Most vessels run Security/2 programs, at a
minimum. The Cybersecurity Tasks table outlines the difficulties of
certain tasks that might be attempted by hijackers and pirates. All
tasks require the Computer skill.

#### Table: Cybersecurity Tasks

| Task                                | Typical Difficulty                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Access ship records                 | Average (+0)                                                        |
| Grant crew authorization to someone | Difficult (-2)                                                      |
| Override key systems                | Formidable (-6)                                                     |
| Override security systems           | Defined by Security software package, typically Very Difficult (-4) |

### Security Measures

Security measures on board a starship activate when an intrusion or
emergency has been detected. These measures include internal alarms,
artificial gravity control, tranq gas and the venting of atmosphere.

**Internal Alarms**: If an alarm is tripped (hull breach, fire, door
being forced open, alarm button pressed) it will alert the crew. The
location of the alarm will be shown on computer displays. The average
passenger ship has several crew trained in combat; military ships will
carry marines. Some vessels will even have security robots who respond
automatically to alarms.

**Artificial Gravity Control**: It is possible to alter the artificial
gravity on board. Reducing gravity to zero will limit actions to the
level of a character’s Zero-G skill. Gravity can also safely be
increased up to 3G.

**Tranq Gas**: Some ships carry tranq gas canisters in the air vents,
which can be released automatically. These flood a compartment with gas
that forces an Endurance check each round, with a –1 DM per previous
check. Any character who fails the Endurance check is knocked
unconscious.

**Venting Atmosphere**: If a compartment is connected to an airlock,
then the air can be vented from that area. Characters in that area must
make a Strength check to hang on and will also begin to suffocate.
Internal doors on a ship are airtight, so portions of the ship can be
selectively vented, dependent on the ship's floor plan and the relative
positions of airlocks.

## Planetary Travel on Other Worlds

On-planet, and in civilized areas, regular services may be available for
a few Crowns, allowing characters to ride to their destination aboard
anything from a rickshaw to a maglev bullet train. In the course of
their adventures, characters may ride aboard steam ships, dirigibles,
submersibles, grav speeders or atop living mounts. Costs are fairly
negligible for such travel. Assume a basic cost of 1D6X5 Crowns per day
of travel.

If the characters wish to use a vehicle of their own, this cost is not
necessary. However, a suitable vehicle must be available.

## Characters and the Law

In each of the situations listed in the Potential Law Enforcement
Encounters table, roll 2D6 and add the listed modifiers. If the total is
lower than the planet's Law Level, the characters are investigated or
challenged by agents of planetary law enforcement.

#### Table: Potential Law Enforcement Encounters

| Situation                                                   | DM  | Response    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-------------|
| First approach to a planet                                  | +0  | Check       |
| Offworlders wandering the streets of a city (once per day)  | +0  | Check       |
| Offworlders acting suspiciously                             | –1  | Check       |
| Bar fight                                                   | –1  | Combat      |
| Shots fired                                                 | –2  | Combat      |
| Breaking and entering                                       | –2  | Investigate |
| Firefight involving armored characters and military weapons | –4  | Combat      |
| Murder and carnage                                          | –4  | Investigate |

Check means that the characters' travel documents and identities are
checked, either by a police officer or guard, or electronically by
querying the characters' comms. A successful Admin or Streetwise roll
can allay suspicion, but if this check is failed, the planetary
authorities move on to Investigate.

Investigate means that a detective or bureaucrat probes deeper into the
characters' backgrounds. If the characters have a ship, it will be
searched. They may be followed, or have their communications tapped.
They may also be questioned closely.

Finally, Combat means that the police show up ready for a fight. Their
response will generally be proportional to the threat posed by the
player characters; if the characters are just making trouble in a bar,
then most police forces will just use batons, tranq gas and other
non-lethal weapons. On the other hand, if the characters are in Battle
Dress and firing PGMPs at the palace of the planetary governor, then the
police will show up with the best weapons and armor available at the
planet's TL (or even a few levels higher).

### Arrests and Sentencing

Characters arrested for a crime will face punishment, determined by
rolling 2D6+DMs on the Sentencing table. For crimes involving smuggling
banned goods, the DM is equal to the difference between the planet's Law
Level and the banned goods in question. Other crimes have a set DM, per
the Sentencing Modifiers by Crime table.

#### Table: Sentencing Modifiers by Crime

| Crime                   | DM           |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Assault                 | Law Level –5 |
| Destruction of Property | Law Level –3 |
| False Identity          | Law Level –2 |
| Manslaughter            | Law Level –1 |
| Murder                  | Law Level +0 |

A character with the Advocate skill may attempt to reduce the severity
of sentencing by making a check. If successful, reduce the Sentencing DM
by the Effect of the check.

#### Table: Sentencing

| Result    | Sentence                                                     |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 or less | Dismissed or trivial punishment                              |
| 1–2       | Fine of 1D6x ₢1,000                                          |
| 3–4       | Fine of 2D6x ₢5,000                                          |
| 5–6       | Exile or a fine of 2D6x ₢10,000                              |
| 7–8       | Imprisonment for 1D6 months or exile or fine of 2D6x₢ 20,000 |
| 9–10      | Imprisonment for 1D6 years or exile                          |
| 11–12     | Imprisonment for 2D6 years or exile                          |
| 13–14     | Life imprisonment                                            |
| 15+       | Death                                                        |

A result of Exile means that the character must leave the planet
immediately and never return. Fines for smuggling goods are per ton of
goods seized – gun running can be an extremely risky proposition.

# CHAPTER 7: TRADE AND COMMERCE

As outlined under **Starship Revenues** in **Chapter 6: Off-World
Travel**, a vessel can easily haul cargo for a flat rate, without having
to engage in speculative trading. However, for those merchants willing
to take the risk, speculative trading can prove to be a very profitable
enterprise. This chapter provides a simple speculative trade system for
use in Märchen Engine campaigns, for those interested in such pursuits.

## Speculative Trade Checklist

Speculative trading follows a basic procedure. The following checklist
outlines the various steps in the speculative trade procedure.

1.  Find a supplier

2.  Determine goods available

3.  Determine purchase price

4.  Take goods to new world or market

5.  Find a buyer

6.  Determine sales price

## Find a Supplier

The first step in the process is simple: find a supplier with something
to sell. Characters can search for multiple suppliers, but there is a –1
DM per previous attempt on a planet in a given month.

*Finding a supplier*: Broker, Education or Social Standing, 1D6 days,
Average (+0).

*Finding a black market supplier*: (Illegal goods only) Streetwise,
Education or Social Standing, 1D6 days, Average (+0).

*Finding an online supplier*: (Worlds with TL 8+ only) Computers,
Education, 1D6 hours, Average (+0).

The size of the Starport provides a bonus to finding a supplier. Class A
starports give a +6 DM, class B starports give a +4 DM and class C
starports give a +2 DM.

## Determine Goods Available

Goods are divided into two categories of goods – Common and Trade Goods.
Common Goods can be purchased on any world. Trade Goods can usually only
be found on a world with a matching trade code. The amount of each type
of goods available is limited – the tons column on the Trade Goods table
determines how many tons of a given type of goods is available for
purchase.

A given supplier has all Common Goods available and 1D6 randomly
determined goods. Roll D66 on the table to determine the goods
available, ignoring results 61–65 unless dealing with a black market
supplier. If you roll the same type of goods multiple times, then the
supplier has extra amounts of those goods available.

Some goods are illegal, and can be purchased only through a black market
supplier. A black market supplier has whatever illegal goods match his
world’s trade code, as well as any randomly rolled illegal goods. Other
goods may be legal on some worlds, but not legal on others (such as
personal weapons and armor, which might be restricted on a world with a
high law level). The Referee should adjudicate such situations as they
occur.

#### Table: Common Goods

| Item                     | Cost (Cr) | Tons  |
|--------------------------|-----------|-------|
| Basic Consumable Goods   | ₢ 1,000   | 2D6x5 |

**\*Note**: Unusual cargo covers unique or highly unusual items, such as
alien artifacts, high tech prototypes, stolen artwork of antiquity, or
unique lifeforms. Such items often form the seed for an adventure.

## Determine Purchase Price

Determining the purchase price for speculative cargo is based on the
results of a skill check. The results of this skill check represents the
best possible offer the parties can reach under the current conditions.

*Determining the purchase price*: Broker, Intelligence or Social
Standing, 1D6 kiloseconds, Average (+0).

The skill check is further modified by adding the largest Dice Modifier
that applies from the Purchase DM column, subtracting the largest Dice
Modifier that applies from the Sale DM column, and subtracting any Dice
Modifiers from the supplier (such as their Broker skill). Some
especially rich or powerful suppliers can demand high prices. In cases
where multiple Purchase or Sale DMs apply, use only the largest ones
from each column.

The Referee should then consult the Purchase column of the Modified
Price table, using the skill check result to determine the Purchase
Price percentage. The final price of the speculative cargo is the Base
Price multiplied by the Purchase Price percentage. The trader does not
have to accept this price, but if he rejects the deal, then he cannot
deal with that supplier again for at least one week. After that week, he
may attempt a new skill check to determine the purchase price for those
goods.

| 2-     | 200%     | 40%  |

### Local Brokers

A speculative trader can hire a local broker to represent him in trade
negotiations. This allows the merchant to use the broker’s skill levels
instead of their own, although that comes at a price in the form of a
percentage of the final negotiated price, which must be paid even if the
merchant decides not to sell his goods. The Local Broker table indicates
the commission charged for a given skill level, as well as indicating
what maximum skill levels are commonly available for a given class of
starport.

#### Table: Local Brokers

| Skill Level | Commission | Notes                         |
|-------------|------------|-------------------------------|
| 1           | 5%         | Max for Class D or E Starport |
| 2           | 10%        | Max for Class C Starport      |
| 3           | 15%        | Max for Class B Starport      |
| 4           | 20%        | Max for Class A Starport      |

## Selling Goods

Selling goods works just like purchasing goods, with the following
changes:

A character must find a buyer, instead of a supplier. The same rules
apply.

When selling goods, add the largest Sale DMs for the world trade code
and subtract the largest Purchase DMs.

If a character does not accept the price offered for his goods, he must
find another buyer or wait a week, in which case he may attempt a new
skill check to determine the selling price.

# CHAPTER 8: SHIP DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION

Space ships are the backbone of any starfaring campaign. This chapter
provides rules for the design and construction of such vessels for use
in Märchen Engine campaigns. Any class A starport has a shipyard which
can build any kind of ship, including a starship with Jump drives; any
class B starport can build small craft and ships which do not have Jump
drives.

## Standard Designs vs. New Designs

An interstellar economy provides an excellent opportunity for the use of
standardized and modular designs. Components can be crafted on different
worlds, taking advantage of available resources, and then put together
to create a final product. Shipyards take advantage of modular
components and standardized designs to reduce costs in production, which
leads to a 10% discount on vessels constructed using common designs,
such as those described in **Chapter 9: Common Vessels**. The Referee
may designate other ship designs as standard designs, as befits their
universe. Fuel and weapon ammunition are not covered by the standard
design discount.

New and unique ship designs cannot take advantage of standardized and
modular design. These ships must be designed by a naval architect, who
creates detailed design plans based on a set of specifications provided
by their client. Such plans take a month to create, and costs
approximately 1% of the final cost of the vessel.

## Ship Design Checklist

Space ship design follows a very methodical process in the Märchen
Engine rules.

1.  Choose a Ship Hull

    1.  Determine hull configuration

    2.  Install armor (optional)

2.  Choose maneuver drive (optional, but highly recommended)

3.  Choose jump drive (optional)

4.  Choose power plant

5.  Determine fuel requirements

6.  Determine bridge

7.  Choose ship’s computer

    1.  Choose computer software

8.  Choose ship’s electronics

9.  Determine number of required crew

    1.  Choose staterooms and low berths

10. Determine additional features (optional)

11. Determine turrets, bays or screens (optional)

    1.  Determine weapons (optional)

12. Allocate remaining space to cargo

13. Calculate final cost and construction time

    1.  Apply standard design discount of 10% (optional)

## A Note on System Redundancy

Ship systems take damage for a variety of reasons, becoming disabled or
destroyed as damage accumulates. To counter the loss of vital ship
systems, some ship designers install multiple versions of certain
components. These redundant systems remain inactive until the original
system is disabled, with the exception of ship weaponry. When all
redundant systems have been disabled, any further damage begins to
destroy them, beginning with the primary system.

## Displacement Tons

Hulls and other ship components are designated by their displacement
volume. Displacement volume is measured in the volume of space that is
displaced by one metric ton of hydrogen, referred to in this design
sequence as displacement tons or simply tons.

A metric ton of hydrogen measures approximately 13.5 cubic meters, which
is rounded to 14 cubic meters for ease of calculations. When drawing
floor plans or maps of ships, each square measuring 1.5 meters by 1.5
meters, to a height of 3m up from the floor, represents half a ton.

## Ship Hull

The ship’s hull is the shell in which all other components are placed. A
ship’s construction time is based on its hull size, as outlined on the
Ship Hull table.

#### Table: Ship Hull by Displacement

| Hull       | Hull Code | Price (M₢) | Construction Time (weeks) |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------------------------|

### Ship Configuration 

A ship may have any of three configurations – standard (a wedge, cone,
sphere or cylinder), streamlined (a wing, disc or other lifting body
allowing it to enter the atmosphere easily) or distributed (made up of
several sections, and incapable of entering an atmosphere or maintaining
its shape under gravity).

**Standard**: A standard-hull ship may still enter atmosphere but is
very ungainly and ponderous, capable only of making a controlled glide
to the surface. Getting it back into space requires an elaborate launch
setup and considerable expense. A standard-hull ship may have scoops for
gathering fuel from a gas giant but the process will be much more
difficult and less efficient. Larger ships of this type will often carry
a specialized sub-craft to perform the actual atmospheric skimming.

**Streamlined**: Streamlining a ship increases the cost of the hull by
10%. This streamlining includes fuel scoops which allow the skimming of
unrefined fuel from gas giants or the gathering of water from open lakes
or oceans. Streamlining may not be retrofitted; it must be included at
the time of construction.

**Distributed**: A distributed ship reduces the cost of its hull by 10%.
It is completely non-aerodynamic and if it enters an atmosphere or
strong gravity it will fall to the surface of the planet. It cannot
mount fuel scoops.

#### Table: Ship Configuration

| Configuration | Hull Cost Modifier | Notes                                                                                             |
|---------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Distributed   | x0.9               | Cannot mount fuel scoops. Atmospheric operations suffer -4 DM (failed checks inflict 2D6 damage). |
| Standard      | x1.0               | Atmospheric operations suffer a -2 DM.                                                            |
| Streamlined   | x1.1               | Includes fuel scoops.                                                                             |

### Ship Armor

Armor is added in 5% increments of the ship’s tonnage. An armored ship
decreases radiation exposure from space phenomena by 400 rads. (This
does not apply to meson attacks and nuclear missiles, which bypass the
armor or breach the hull to deliver their radiation hits.)

#### Table: Ship Armor by Type

| Armor Type        | TL  | Protection              | Cost             |
|-------------------|-----|-------------------------|------------------|
| Titanium Steel    | 7   | 2 per 5%, minimum 1 ton | 5% of base hull  |
| Crystaliron       | 10  | 4 per 5%, minimum 1 ton | 20% of base hull |
| Bonded Superdense | 14  | 6 per 5%, minimum 1 ton | 50% of base hull |

For example, a heavily armored warship might take Bonded Superdense
armor twice. This would take up 10% of the hull’s volume and cost 100%
of the base cost of the hull, but give 12 points of armor.

### Ship Armor Options

The following are options that can be added to a ship’s armor.

**Reflec** (TL 10): Reflec coating on the hull increases the ship’s
armor against lasers by 3. Adding Reflec costs M₢0.1 per ton of hull and
can only be added once.

**Self-Sealing** (TL 9): A self-sealing hull automatically repairs minor
breaches such as micrometeoroid impacts, and prevents hull hits from
leading to explosive decompression. It costs M₢0.01 per ton of hull.

**Stealth** (TL 11): A stealth coating absorbs radar and lidar beams,
and also disguises heat emissions. This gives a –4 DM on any Comms rolls
to detect or lock onto the ship. Adding Stealth costs M₢0.1 per ton of
hull, and can only be added once.

### Hull and Structure

Initial damage is applied to the Hull; once the Hull is breached,
further damage goes to the Structure. When all Structure Points have
been lost, the ship has been smashed to pieces. A ship has one Hull
Point per 50 tons of displacement (rounded down) and one Structure Point
per 50 tons of displacement (rounded up).

## Ship Sections

Most vessels are divided into two primary sections.

### The Engineering Section

The Engineering section contains the drives and power plant necessary
for proper operation and movement.

### The Main Compartment

The ship’s main compartment contains all non-drive features of the ship,
including the bridge, ship’s computer, the staterooms, the low passage
berths, the cargo hold and other items.

## Ship Drives

A non-starship must have a maneuver drive (M-Drive) and a power plant
(P-Plant). A starship must have a Jump drive (J-Drive) and a power
plant; a maneuver drive may also be installed, but is not required.

#### Table: Drive Performance by Hull Volume, Larger Hulls

For maneuver drives, the potential is the Thrust number (Tn), which is
the number of Gs acceleration available. For Jump drives, the potential
is the Jump number (Jn), or Jump range in parsecs. The power plant
rating (A-Z) must be at least equal to either the maneuver drive or Jump
drive rating, whichever is higher.

### Fuel

Fuel needed for a Jump depends on the size of the ship and the length of
the Jump and is calculated as 0.1 x Hull tonnage x Jump distance. A
single Jump of that distance consumes that much fuel.

The amount of fuel required by the power plant depends on the tonnage of
the power plant itself, and is calculated as one-third of the power
plant tonnage per week, rounded down to the nearest ton. Space-faring
vessels require a minimum of two weeks’ worth of fuel for the power
plant. Deep space vessels may store four, six or even eight weeks of
power plant fuel. For your convenience, the Power Plant Fuel
Requirements table provides calculated values for both the fuel per week
and minimum fuel volume by Drive Code.

## Bridge

The size of the bridge varies depending on the size of the ship. The
cost for the ship’s bridge is M₢0.5 per 100 tons of ship.

#### Table: Bridge Size

| Ship Size            | Bridge Size |
|----------------------|-------------|
| 200 tons or less     | 10 tons     |
| 300 tons – 1000 tons | 20 tons     |
| 1,100 – 2000 tons    | 40 tons     |
| More than 2,000 tons | 60 tons     |

## Ship Computer

The ship computer is identified by its model number; the computer table
indicates details of price, capacity, and tech level available.

#### Table: Ship Computer Models

| Computer | TL  | Rating | Cost     |
|----------|-----|--------|----------|
| Model 1  | 7   | 5      | ₢30,000  |
| Model 2  | 9   | 10     | ₢160,000 |
| Model 3  | 11  | 15     | M₢2      |
| Model 4  | 12  | 20     | M₢5      |

| Model 6  | 14  | 30     | M₢20     |
| Model 7  | 15  | 35     | M₢30     |

### Ship Computer Options

The following options are available for ship’s computers.

**Jump Control Specialization** (bis): A computer’s rating can be
increased by 5 for the purposes of running Jump Control programs only.
This increases the computer’s cost by 50%.

**Hardened Systems** (fib): A computer and its connections can be
hardened against attack by electromagnetic pulse weapons. A hardened
system is immune to EMP, but costs 50% more.

Both options can be applied to the same computer by doubling its cost
(+100%).

### Ship Software

Ship computers run highly specialized software packages designed to
support numerous functions, such as managing the Jump drive, evading
incoming fire, controlling ship’s weapons and executing automatic
repairs. Ship’s computers automatically provide the means for basic
control of the vessel, as well as extensive library data on numerous
topics and a basic level of security (Security/0).

## Ship Electronics

A ship comes with a basic communications, sensor and emissions-control
electronics suite, but more advanced systems can be installed. The Dice
Modifier applies to jamming and counter-jamming attempts.

#### Table: Ship Electronics

| System         | TL  | DM  | Includes                                                    | Tons               | Cost               |
|----------------|-----|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|

**Radar/Lidar** detects physical objects. It can be active or passive.
If a ship is using active sensors, it is easier to detect (+2 DM to
Comms checks) but detects more about its surroundings.

**Jammers** can jam or counter-jam radio communications and sensor
locks.

**Densitometers** can determine the internal structure and makeup of an
object.

**Neural Activity Sensor** detects neural activity and intelligence.

## Ship Crew

All vessels require a crew to operate and maintain the ship. Small
independently-owned vessels tend to operate with a minimum of crew,
while corporate and military vessels maintain a full complement.

#### Table: Ship Crew Requirements

| Position               | Minimum                               | Full Complement                                                                                                       |

### Staterooms

Each stateroom is sufficient for one person, displaces 4 tons, and costs
₢500,000. No stateroom can contain more than two persons, such as for
middle passengers, as it would strain the ship’s life support equipment.
The tonnage and cost of the staterooms includes the life support systems
needed to keep the crew alive.

### Low Passage Berths

One low passage berth carries one low passenger, costs ₢50,000, and
displaces one-half ton.

Emergency low berths are also available; they will not carry passengers,
but can be used for survival. Each costs ₢100,000 and displaces one ton.
Each holds four persons.

### Barracks

A barracks takes up 2 tons per marine, and costs M₢0.1 per marine.
Barracks can only be used to accommodate troops intended for boarding or
assault operations. Troops accommodated in barracks cannot be used to
reduce the number of service crew embarked.

## Additional Ship Components

The following are examples of additional ship components that might
prove useful for certain ship designs.

### Armory

Ships carrying a large number of marines or soldiers can benefit from an
armory, a specialized weapons store. An armory can only be accessed by
those with the correct codes (usually the ship’s senior officers and
security team) and contains a wide variety of weapons. In game terms, an
armory has enough snub pistols for the crew, enough accelerator or gauss
rifles for any marines, and a selection of other military equipment like
grenades, combat drug packs, combat armor and communications equipment.
A general armory for a spacecraft costs M₢0.5 and takes up 2 tons of
space.

Where military vessels are concerned, the number of armories built into
the ship’s design is based on crew size. One armory is installed for
either every 50 crew members, or every 10 marines, in order to provide
adequate storage for equipment, weapons and ammunition.

### Briefing Room

A specialized briefing room is useful on mercenary cruisers and other
adventuring ships, where teams can discuss plans or meet with clients
privately. A briefing room gives a +1 DM to Tactics checks made when
planning missions on board ship. Ships with command bridges and fighter
squadrons require additional briefing rooms and facilities. Capital
ships must therefore have one briefing room per ship section, and one
briefing room for every 20 fighter or bomber crew.

### Cargo Hold

The design plan must indicate cargo capacity. There is no cost but cargo
carried may not exceed cargo capacity. Any space left over after all
systems have been installed may be allocated to cargo space.

### Detention Cells

Found primarily on military and government vessels, a detention cell is
used to keep prisoners. A detention cell displaces 2 tons and costs
M₢0.25.

### Fuel Scoops

Fuel scoops allow an unstreamlined ship to gather unrefined fuel from a
gas giant. Streamlined ships have fuel scoops built in. Adding scoops
costs M₢1 and requires no tonnage.

### Fuel Processors

Fuel processors convert unrefined fuel into refined fuel. One ton of
fuel processors can convert 20 tons of unrefined hydrogen into refined
fuel per day. A ton of fuel processing equipment costs ₢50,000.

### Laboratory

Space allocated to laboratories can be used for research and
experimentation. Each four tons of lab space allows for one scientist to
perform research on board ship. The cost for research equipment varies
depending on the type of research undertaken, but is generally around
M₢1.0 per 4 tons.

### Launch Tubes

Launching and recovering small craft from a larger vessel is usually an
activity taking 30 minutes to launch or recovery one craft. Launch tubes
allow small craft to be launched and recovered rapidly from a ship. The
size of a launch tube is twenty–five times the tonnage of the largest
craft that will be deployed in this manner, and they cost M₢0.5 per ton.
With a launch tube, up to ten small craft can be launched per round.
Multiple launch tubes can be installed.

### Library

A library room contains computer files as well as lecterns, display
screens, holotanks and even hard copies of books. A good library is
useful for both research and passing time in jump space. Having a
library on board a ship gives one extra week of training time for new
skills per week spent in jump space. A library for a spacecraft costs
M₢4 and takes up 4 tons of space.

### Luxuries

Luxuries cost ₢100,000 per ton, and make life on board ship more
pleasant. Each ton of luxuries counts as one level of the Steward skill
for the purposes of carrying passengers, and therefore allows a ship to
carry middle and high passage passengers without carrying a trained
steward on board.

### Ship’s Locker

Every ship has a ship’s locker. Typical equipment carried aboard will
include protective clothing, vacc suits, weapons such as shotguns or
pistols, ammunition, compasses and survival aids, and portable shelters.
The contents of the locker are defined only when they need to be but
always contains vacc suits and other useful items. The ship’s locker is
usually protected by a biometric lock keyed to the ship’s officers.

### Vault

A vault is a special armored chamber in the heart of a spacecraft,
designed to survive attacks that would annihilate the rest of the ship.
A vault has another four Hull and Structure points that only come into
play when the ship housing the vault is destroyed. A vault can contain
cargo, staterooms or any other internal components equivalent up to 6
tons. A vault requires 12 tons of space and costs M₢6.

### Vehicle and Drone Hangar

The tonnage and cost outlined in the Hangar Cost and Tonnage for
Vehicles and Drones table covers full-scale hangar space, which allows
for repairs and maintenance of small craft when they are back on the
ship. The hangar includes spare parts and specialized testing and repair
equipment for the stored craft. It does not include the cost of the
vehicles or drones. A custom hangar takes up tonnage equal to the
tonnage of the vehicle to be stored, plus 30% and costs M₢0.2 per ton.

**Air/Raft, ATV**: These are vehicles, stored in or on the ship.

**Escape Pods**: This covers the installation of rescue bubbles and
other escape pods for the entire crew.

**Life Boat, Ship’s Boat, Shuttle, Pinnace, Cutter**: These are all
small craft, hangered either in or on the ship’s hull.

**Mining Drones**: Mining drones allow a ship to mine asteroids. Each
set of mining drones takes up ten tons, and allows the ship to process
1D6x10 tons of asteroid per working day. The tonnage allocated includes
ore handling machinery, allowing the ship to take on ore and transfer it
to the cargo bay.

**Probe Drones**: Probe drones are for surveying planetary surfaces.
Each ton of probe drones contains five drones. Probe drones can be
dropped from orbit in disposable entry shells but must be recovered
manually. Probe drones are also capable of surveying orbiting
satellites, derelicts and other space debris. They can also be used as
communications relays.

**Repair Drones**: Carrying repair drones allows a ship to make
battlefield repairs with the AutoRepair software or when managed by a
character with Mechanic or Engineer skills. Repair drones have the same
statistics as repair robots only without an Intellect program. For more
information on repair robots, see **Robots and Drones** in **Chapter 4:
Equipment**.

#### Table: Hangar Cost and Tonnage for Vehicles and Drones

| Vehicle or Drone | Tons              | Installation Cost (M₢) |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| ATV              | 13                | M₢ 2.6                 |
| Air/Raft         | 5                 | M₢ 1                   |
| Cutter           | 65                | M₢ 13                  |
| Escape Pods      | 0.5 per passenger | M₢ 0.1 per passenger   |
| Life Boat        | 26                | M₢ 5.2                 |
| Mining Drones    | 10                | M₢ 2                   |
| Pinnace          | 52                | M₢ 10.4                |
| Probe Drones (5) | 1                 | M₢ 0.2                 |
| Repair Drones    | 1% of ship’s hull | M₢ 0.2 per ton         |
| Ship’s Boat      | 39                | M₢ 7.8                 |
| Shuttle          | 122.5             | M₢ 24.5                |

## Armaments

A ship has one hardpoint per 100 tons of ship and each weapon system
takes up one hardpoint. A weapon system may include multiple weapons –
for example, a triple turret contains three lasers, missile launchers,
sandcasters or some combination of three weapons.

### Turrets

One turret may be attached to each hardpoint on the ship. If a turret is
installed, then one ton of space must be allocated to fire control
systems:

#### Table: Turret Displacement and Cost

| Weapon         | TL  | Tons | Cost (M₢) |
|----------------|-----|------|-----------|
| Single Turret  | 7   | 1    | M₢ 0.2    |
| Double Turret  | 8   | 1    | M₢ 0.5    |
| Triple Turret  | 9   | 1    | M₢ 1      |
| Pop-Up Turret  | 10  | 2    | M₢ +1     |
| Fixed Mounting | \-  | 0    | M₢ x 0.5  |

**Single**, **Double** and **Triple** turrets can hold one, two or three
weapons.

**Pop-Up** is a quality that can be applied to any type of turret – the
turret is concealed in a pod or recess on the hull, and is detectable
only when deployed. A ship with all its weapons in pop-up turrets looks
unarmed to a casual sensor scan.

**Fixed Mounting** weapons cannot move, are limited to firing in one
direction (normally straight ahead), and are found mainly on fighters. A
fixed mounting costs half as much as a turret of the same type, so a
single fixed mounting costs M₢0.1, a double fixed mounting costs M₢0.25,
and a triple fixed mounting costs M₢0.5.

#### Table: Turret Weapons

| Weapon        | TL  | Optimum Range | Damage              | Cost (M₢) | Notes                  |
|---------------|-----|---------------|---------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Missile Rack  | 6   | Special       | Depends on missile  | M₢ 0.75   |                        |
| Pulse Laser   | 7   | Short         | 2D6                 | M₢ 0.5    | Suffers DM-2 to attack |
| Sandcaster    | 7   | Special       | Special             | M₢ 0.25   |                        |
| Particle Beam | 8   | Long          | 3D6 + radiation hit | M₢ 4      |                        |
| Beam Laser    | 9   | Medium        | 1D6                 | M₢ 1      |                        |

**Missile racks** launch self-propelled weapons designed to explode on
impact.

**Pulse lasers** fire short, rapid bursts of intense energy. Pulse
lasers are notoriously inaccurate and suffer a DM -2 on all attack
rolls.

**Sandcasters** reduces the damage from a beam weapon by 1D6.
Sandcasters require ammunition. Twenty sandcaster barrels take up one
ton of space, can be manufactured at TL5, and cost ₢10,000.

**Particle beams** fire a high-energy beam of subatomic particles. The
beam’s impact disrupts the molecular structure of the target, causing a
radiation crew hit in addition to normal damage.

**Beam lasers** fire a continuous stream of intense energy.

No launcher includes ammunition in its purchase cost. Missiles,
torpedoes and so forth must be purchased separately.

### Missiles

Missiles are weapons that are self-propelled or directed by remote
control, carrying a conventional or nuclear explosive. They may be fired
from missile racks mounted in turrets or from bay-mounted missile banks.
Twelve missiles take up one ton of space. Missiles are capable of Thrust
10, but have a limited endurance of 60 minutes (roughly 4 turns) before
running out of fuel. There are three common types of missiles: Standard,
Smart and Nuclear.

#### Table: Missile Types

| Missile Type | TL  | Damage               | Cost per Missile | Notes                                                                                                                |
|--------------|-----|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nuclear      | 6   | 2D6+ 1 radiation hit | ₢3,750           | Radiation hit suffers a –DM equal to the ship's armor                                                                |
| Standard     | 6   | 1D6                  | ₢1,250           |                                                                                                                      |
| Smart        | 8   | 1D6                  | ₢2,500           | Attack roll is always 8+, and may attack every turn if they miss until they are destroyed, jammed or run out of fuel |

### Bays

Bay weapons are much larger than turrets, and take up 50 tons of space
and one hard point, as well as one ton of space for fire control.

#### Table: Bay Weapons

| Weapon        | TL  | Range   | Damage                               | Cost (M₢) |
|---------------|-----|---------|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| Missile Bank  | 6   | Special | Launches a flight of twelve missiles | M₢ 12     |
| Particle Beam | 8   | Long    | 6D6 + 1 radiation hit                | M₢ 20     |
| Meson Gun     | 11  | Long    | 5D6 + 1 radiation hit                | M₢ 50     |
| Fusion Gun    | 12  | Medium  | 5D6                                  | M₢ 8      |

**Missile banks** fire flights of twelve missiles at a time.

**Particle beam** bays fire a larger and more powerful beam of subatomic
particles than particle beam turret weapons.

**Meson weapons** are unaffected by armor, as the blast only becomes
harmful after it has already passed through the hull. Meson guns also
inflict an automatic radiation hit on the crew of any target struck.

**Fusing weapons** fire a stream of hydrogen particles that are
undergoing a fusion reaction.

### Screens

Screens are defensive systems that protect against specific attacks.

#### Table: Screens

| Screen         | TL  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Tons | Cost (M₢) |
|----------------|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-----------|
| Meson Screen   | 12  | Protects against meson weapon damage, reducing damage by 2D6. Meson screens reduce radiation damage from meson guns and meson flicker weapons. Radiation hits from these weapons suffer a –DM equal to twice the active number of screens. | 50   | M₢ 60     |
| Nuclear Damper | 12  | Reduces fusion gun damage and nuclear missile damage by 2D6, removes automatic radiation hit from nuclear missile attacks                                                                                                                  | 50   | 50        |

**Meson screens** block attacks from meson weapons by preventing meson
decay.

**Nuclear dampers** inhibit fusion reactions, reducing the damage from
fusion weapons and nuclear missiles by 2D6 when affected.

## Universal Ship Description Format

After a ship design has been created, it must be presented in a format
that allows players to use the information within the game. The Märchen
Engine describes ship designs using a universal ship description format,
which is essentially a paragraph of text laid out in the following
manner. Examples can be found in **Chapter 9: Common Vessels**.

\[Ship's Tech Level\] \[Ship Descriptive Name\]

Using a \[Ship Hull Displacement\]-ton hull (\[Hull Damage Value\] Hull,
\[Structure Damage Value\] Structure,), the \[Ship Descriptive Name\] is
\[General Description of Ship's Function\]. It mounts jump drive \[Jump
Drive Code\], maneuver drive \[Maneuver Drive Code\], and power plant
\[Power Plant Code\], giving a performance of Jump-\[Jump Number\] and
\[Thrust Number\]-G acceleration. Fuel tankage of \[Fuel Tonnage\] tons
supports the power plant for \[Weeks of Power\] and \[Number of Jumps\]
jump-\[Jump Number\]. \[Any additional fuel usage notes.\] Adjacent to
the bridge is a computer Model \[Computer Number, followed by a slash
and bis or fib options noted, if purchased\]. The ship is equipped with
\[Sensors Type\] sensors (\[Sensors DM\].) There are \[Number of
Staterooms\] staterooms and \[Number of Low Berths\] low berths. The
ship has \[Number of Hardpoints\] hardpoints and \[Fire Control
Tonnage\] tons allocated for fire control. Installed on the hardpoints
are \[Describe number and type of turrets, and any weapon systems that
have been installed, if any. Also note any ammunition carried for
missiles and sandcasters.\] This ship has \[Number of Screens
Installed\] screens: \[Describe number and type of screens\]. There are
\[Number of Small Craft Hangers\] small craft hangars, \[Describe number
and contents of each hangar\]. Cargo capacity is \[Cargo Tonnage\] tons.
The hull is \[Hull Configuration\], and is armored with \[Armor Type\]
(\[Armor Rating\] points.) \[Note any Ship's Armor options that have
been installed.\] Special features include \[List additional components
here, included fuel processors and fuel scoops\]. The ship requires a
crew of \[Crew Total\]: \[List crew positions\]. The ship can carry up
to \[Double the Number of Non-Crew Staterooms\] additional passengers at
double occupancy and \[Number of Low Berths\] low passengers. The ship
costs M₢\[Cost of Ship\] (including discounts and fees) and takes
\[Construction Time\] weeks to build.

## Alternative Star Drives

In classic era science-fiction games such as the Märchen Engine, the
only form of faster-than-light movement is typically the Jump drive,
which always takes one week to travel a number of parsecs equal to its
Jump rating and consumes a vast amount of fuel. If the Referee wishes to
model other science fiction settings with their own forms of “star
drive”, the classic Jump drive rules may not be entirely appropriate.
The alternative drives below use all the same rules as the Jump drive
(mass, fuel, power consumption, range) unless otherwise stated.

Some of these drives consume much less fuel or allow much faster travel
than the Jump drive, so introducing these drives will vastly impact the
carrying capacity of a starship, the profitability of trade, the speed
of communication and so forth.

### Warp Drive

The ship warps space around it, allowing it to move faster-than-light
while staying in our universe. A warp drive does not have a maximum
range – instead, the ship’s drive rating indicates the number of parsecs
crossed per week of travel. Warp travel consumes fuel at twice the
normal rate for the ship’s power plant rather than needing a single
massive expenditure in the manner of a Jump drive.

### Teleport Drive

The ship instantaneously jumps from one point to another. This works
just like the standard Jump drive without the week-long wait in
hyperspace. Instead, no time whatsoever elapses during the transition
from one place to another. A teleport consumes no extra fuel but jumping
is a strain on the ship’s systems and multiple successive jumps can
damage the drive.

### Hyperspace Drive

The portal drive functions by opening up a gateway into hyperspace,
through which the ship can pass. When in hyperspace, the ship uses its
conventional engines to travel, then opens up a second gateway back to
the normal universe, effectively taking a short cut through a higher
dimension. A hyperspace drive is limited by the size of the spacecraft
that can pass through the portal – see the Hyperspace Portal Size table.
A hyperspace drive consumes no extra fuel, but takes up twice as much
space as a jump drive. While in hyperspace, the spacecraft moves at a
rate of one parsec per day per maneuver drive rating.

#### Table: Hyperspace Portal Size

| Rating | Size | Rating | Size |
|--------|------|--------|------|
| A      | 200  | **N**  | 2800 |
| B      | 400  | **P**  | 3000 |
| C      | 800  | **Q**  | 3200 |
| D      | 1000 | **R**  | 3400 |
| E      | 1200 | **S**  | 3600 |
| F      | 1400 | **T**  | 3800 |
| G      | 1600 | **U**  | 4000 |
| H      | 1800 | **V**  | 4200 |
| J      | 2000 | **W**  | 4400 |
| K      | 2200 | **X**  | 4600 |
| L      | 2400 | **Y**  | 4800 |
| M      | 2600 | **Z**  | 5000 |

## Alternative Power Plants

The Märchen Engine system posits the development of highly efficient
fusion power plants, but other settings may use different sources of
power. Unless otherwise noted, these power plants use all the same rules
as the standard fusion power plants.

### Fission Plants

A fission plant requires radioactive elements as fuel. Fission drives
only produce the same amount power as a fusion drive of the same type.
However, they are twice the size and price of a fusion power plant.
Fission plant fuel costs ₢1,000,000 per ton. Fission plants use the same
amount of fuel in a year that standard fusion power plants require for
two weeks.

### Antimatter Power Plants

Antimatter power plants work by annihilating small amounts of hydrogen
and anti-hydrogen. No tonnage needs to be allocated to fuel, but the
plant must be refueled once per month, at a cost of ₢5,000 per ton of
drive.

## Small Craft Design

Small craft design follows the rules for standard ship design, with the
following changes.

### Small Craft Ship Hull

Small craft use the Small Craft Ship Hull by Displacement table below.
The cost of streamlining and distributed configurations are calculated
as per standard ship design rules.

#### Table: Ship Hull by Displacement

| Hull    | Hull Code | Price (M₢) | Construction Time (weeks) |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------------------------|
| 10 tons | s1        | 1.1        | 28                        |
| 15 tons | s2        | 1.15       | 29                        |
| 20 tons | s3        | 1.2        | 29                        |
| 25 tons | s4        | 1.25       | 30                        |
| 30 tons | s5        | 1.3        | 30                        |
| 35 tons | s6        | 1.35       | 30                        |
| 40 tons | s7        | 1.4        | 31                        |
| 45 tons | s8        | 1.45       | 31                        |
| 50 tons | s9        | 1.5        | 32                        |
| 55 tons | sA        | 1.55       | 32                        |
| 60 tons | sB        | 1.6        | 32                        |
| 65 tons | sC        | 1.65       | 33                        |
| 70 tons | sD        | 1.7        | 33                        |
| 75 tons | sE        | 1.75       | 34                        |
| 80 tons | sF        | 1.8        | 34                        |
| 85 tons | sG        | 1.85       | 34                        |
| 90 tons | sH        | 1.9        | 35                        |
| 95 tons | sJ        | 1.95       | 35                        |

### Small Craft Armor

Small craft armor is purchased in the same manner as standard ship
armor. However, small craft have a maximum armor value, based on type.
Armor options may be purchased as per the standard ship design rules.

#### Table: Maximum Small Craft Armor by Type

| Armor Type        | Maximum Armor Value         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|

### Small Craft Fuel

The fuel requirements for a small craft's power plant follow the
standard ship design rules, except the values are rounded down to the
nearest 0.1 of a ton, rather than the nearest ton. In addition, the
minimum fuel volume for a small craft is one week rather than two weeks.
For your convenience, the Small Craft Power Plant Fuel Requirements
table provides calculated values for fuel per week by Drive Code.

### Small Craft Cockpits and Control Cabins

Small craft do not have bridges. Instead, a cockpit or control cabin
serves the same function. A cockpit is more cramped, but takes up less
tonnage. The cost for a cabin or cockpit is the same – M₢ 0.1 per 20
tons of ship. Additional cabin space costs M₢ 0.05 per ton. Cockpits and
control cabins come equipped with a basic communications, sensor and
emissions-control electronics suite. More advanced systems can be
installed per the standard ship design rules.

#### Table: Small Craft Cockpits and Control Cabins

| Small Craft Size    | Size (tons)            | Crew                   |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1-Man Cockpit       | 1.5                    | 1 crew                 |
| 2-Man Cockpit       | 3                      | 2 crew                 |
| 1-Man Control Cabin | 3                      | 1 crew                 |
| 2-Man Control Cabin | 6                      | 2 crew, 1 passenger    |
| More Cabin Space    | 1.5 tons per passenger | 1 additional passenger |

### Airlock

Unlike larger vessels, a small craft does not have an airlock by
default. Airlocks take up one ton each and cost M₢0.2. If a craft does
not have an airlock, then the crew cannot leave the craft except when it
is landed or in a pressurized landing bay without opening the ship up to
vacuum.

### Small Craft Crew

All small craft of 50 tons or under require a minimum crew of one to
operate and maintain the ship. Small craft larger than 50 tons require a
minimum crew of two.

### Small Craft Armaments

A small craft has one hardpoint, despite being less than 100 tons. Small
craft follow the standard ship design rules regarding armaments, with
some exceptions.

Meson, particle beam and fusion bays cannot be fitted.

The armaments allowed to a small craft are restricted by its power plant
type. It may only equip up to the number of lasers and particle weapons
allowed by the vessel’s power plant, as shown in the Maximum Energy
Weapons by Power Plant table. The number of missile launchers or
projectile weapons is not limited by the power plant letter.

#### Table: Maximum Energy Weapons by Power Plant

| Drive Code | Maximum Number |
|------------|----------------|
| sA–sF      | 0              |
| sG–sK      | 1              |
| sL–sR      | 2              |
| sS–sZ      | 3              |

# CHAPTER 10: SPACE COMBAT

Space combat is a staple in classic science fiction, and the Märchen
Engine has rules to cover it. This chapter details the basics for space
combat. These rules for vehicle and starship combat presented here are
designed to allow for more roleplaying and involvement of the
characters. Movement and maneuvering are abstracted to allow for
cinematic battles as vessels attempt to maneuver into a position of
pursuit and advantage against their opponents, or frantically try to
shake pursuit.

Range is similarly abstracted, needing only to note whether the range
for all vessels involved for each round is Close, Short, Medium, Long,
Very Long, or Extreme.

## Space Combat Checklist

Like personal combat, space combat in the Märchen Engine is cyclical.
Everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle called a turn. Each turn in
space combat lasts one kilosecond. Generally, space combat runs in the
following way:

1.  The Referee determines the range at which the encounter begins.

2.  All crew members are assigned to a position on board their vessel.

3.  The Referee determines which characters are aware of their opponents
    at the start of the battle. If some but not all vessels are aware of
    their opponents, the vessels that are aware of their opponents are
    considered to get an automatic 12 on their initiative roll, giving
    them an Initiative of 12 + Dexterity DM.

4.  Any remaining vessels roll initiative. All vessels are now ready to
    begin their first turn of combat.

5.  All vessels act in initiative order.

    1.  At the start of each combat turn, a Captain may declare that
        their crew is acting hastily.

    2.  The crew members of the vessel resolve their actions.

    3.  After every crew member has completed their actions, any damage
        is resolved if the vessel’s weapon systems hit enemy ships.

6.  When every vessel has had a turn, the combatant with the highest
    initiative total acts again, and Step 5 repeats until combat ends.

## Range in Space Combat

If two vessels randomly encounter each other while travelling through
the depths of space, far from any other objects or vessels, the
encounter will begin at Very Long range. More often, ships engage near a
planet, where the range is Short or Medium.

| Sandcaster    | Routine        | Average        | Difficult | --        | --        | --             | --        |

## Crew Positions

At the start of an engagement, all crew must be assigned to a position
on board ship. There can be only one pilot, but other than that, any
number of people can occupy the same position.

#### Table: Crew Positions

| Position               | Responsibility                                                                                                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bay Gunner             | Each bay weapon has its own gunner.                                                                                |
| Captain                | Commands the ship, and can use Leadership and Tactics skills.                                                      |
| Chief Security Officer | Commands marines, and can use Leadership and Tactics skills in abstract boarding actions.                          |
| Damage Control         | A character assigned to free-floating damage control can repair any system.                                        |
| Drive Engineer         | An engineer can be assigned to each of the M-drive and the J-drive.                                                |
| Marine                 | Prepares to repel boarders, or to board enemy ships.                                                               |
| Passenger              | Passengers are all people aboard ship who are not assigned a position and are assumed to be waiting in staterooms. |
| Pilot                  | Flies the ship, responsible for changing course and for evasive maneuvers.                                         |
| Sensors Operator       | A character assigned to communications and sensors.                                                                |
| Turret Gunner          | Each turret has its own gunner. A character must choose which turret he is manning at the start of the combat.     |

### Automated Positions

The ship's computer can cover several positions if it is running the
appropriate software:

- Fire Control programs can either act as **gunners** or aid existing
  gunners.

- A ship equipped with repair drones and Auto-Repair software acts as
  **damage control**.

- A ship running an Intellect program and Expert Pilot can be the
  **pilot**.

- A ship equipped with repair drones and running an Intellect program
  and Expert Engineer can be a **drive engineer**.

## Initiative

Each ship in an engagement rolls 2D6 to determine their starting
Initiative score. The ship with a greater Thrust score gains a +1 DM to
its roll.

The Captain of each vessel (or each fleet, if more than one ship is
involved on each side) may a Tactics check. The Effect is added to the
Initiative of the vessel (or fleet).

## The Space Combat Turn 

Each turn in space combat lasts around one kilosecond (1,000 seconds) of
game time. In a combat turn, vessels have individual Initiative. Actions
are taken in descending order of Initiative. If two vessels have the
same Initiative, the vessel with the highest Thrust goes first. If they
are still tied, then vessels act simultaneously. When a vessel acts, the
crew members of the vessel take all of their actions at once. Each crew
member gets a minor action and a significant action.

Once everyone has acted a combat turn is over and a new turn begins.
Initiative is not re-rolled but is dynamic, and may be adjusted up and
down by actions taken during a turn.

## Note on Personal Actions

As a space combat turn represents over 150 personal combat rounds, it
stands to reason that crew members may engage in a lot of personal
actions over the course of a single combat turn. Much of this is
abstracted into the various space combat actions. Most personal actions
have minimal impact on space combat. For crew members that do want to
pursue a personal action during space combat, such as use a psionic
ability, these actions count as minor actions on the space combat scale.
This glosses over the remainder of the character's time during the
combat turn, and highlights the primary acts that a character might want
to pursue without taking away from the rest of the space combat.

#### Table: Space Combat Action Summary

| Description                    | Type        | Crew Member                    |

## Minor Actions

As in personal combat, minor actions are actions intended to perform
tasks that do not require significant focus and concentration. Each crew
member can take up to three minor actions per turn, at the loss of a
significant action.

### Adjust Speed

The pilot may increase or decrease the vessel's speed up to an amount
equal to its Thrust. This requires no skill check.

### Change Positions

Crew members changes crew positions, and are now considered to be
manning their new position rather than their previous one.

### Maintain Course

The pilot keeps the vessel on its current course and heading, remaining
at the current speed. This requires no skill check.

### Personal Action

A crew member may pursue any personal action that generally takes less
than a minute.

### Miscellaneous 

The Referee may permit a character to perform a skill check or other
action as a minor action if the use of the skill does not require the
character's full attention or complex physical actions.

## Significant Actions

Significant actions are intended to do something within about 3 seconds.
You can perform a single significant action per turn, or forego it to
perform a total of three minor actions.

### Take Minor Actions 

A character can take two minor actions instead of a significant action.

### Attack

A gunner may attack any target within the range of the weapon system
they are manning. The gunner attacks by making a Turret Weapons or Bay
Weapons skill check roll at a Difficulty determined by range, adding any
Computer Targeting, Sensor Targeting, or other modifiers in effect this
round for his vessel. The enemy ship may react by dodging, point defense
or triggering screens (see Reactions). A gunner may fire any or all of
the weapons in his turret or bay but each turret or bay may only fire
once per round. If the attack is successful it will inflict damage.
Damage is resolved after all attacks have been made in a vessel’s turn.
Missiles do not impact in the same round they are launched; their damage
is resolved in the combat turn that they impact their target.

### Avoid Collision

When a vessel is moving at Short or Close range through a debris field,
traffic, an asteroid belt, a planetary ring, or similar situation where
there is a reasonable chance of collision with another object, the pilot
must make an Avoid Collision check each turn. A collision inflicts 1D6
damage for every point of the vessel’s current speed.

#### Table: Collision Avoidance 

| Situation                                              | Difficulty          |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Traffic (5 or more vessels within Short range), debris | Average (+0)        |
| Asteroid field, light density                          | Difficult (-2)      |
| Asteroid field, average density                        | Very Difficult (-4) |
| Asteroid field, heavy density                          | Formidable (-6)     |
| Significant speed difference between ship and debris   | DM -2               |

### Boarding Action

If two ships are Adjacent or docked, then a boarding action can be
attempted. If the ships are docked, then the attackers may cross over
safely via airlocks. If the ships are merely adjacent, then the
attackers must use thruster packs or small craft to cross over. While
crossing, the attackers may be attacked with point defense weapons or by
firing sand. Once across, boarding actions can be resolved using the
personal combat rules or the abstract boarding rules.

### Break Pursuit

If a vessel is being pursued (as per the Pursuit action) the pilot or
driver may break the pursuit with a successful opposed Pilot skill check
against his opponent. Once the pursuit has broken and the pursuing
vessel loses all accumulated attack bonuses against that target.

### Calculate Jump Plot

The navigator can hastily calculate a Jump Plot as a significant action
in space combat. Normally an Easy (+4) Education-based Navigation skill
check, hastening it to fit within one space combat turn imposes a DM-1
on the skill check.

### Dock with Another Vessel

The pilot must make a successful Average(+0) Pilot check. If the other
ship does not wish to be docked with then make opposed Pilot checks; the
ship trying to dock suffers a –2 DM. When docked, boarding actions can
take place.

### Coordinate Crew

The Captain makes an Average(+0) Leadership skill check. The Captain
gains a pool of points equal to the Effect of the skill check (minimum
of 1), which he can distribute to individual crew members as DMs
(granting a +1 DM per point) on skill or ability checks during the
combat turn.

### Electronic Warfare

A sensors operator may attempt to jam radio communications and sensor
locks by making an opposed Intelligence-based Comms check against the
sensors operator of the opposing vessel. Electronic warfare can be used
to break sensor locks.

Alternatively, electronic warfare can be used to attack smart missiles
that are targeting the ship. The sensors operator makes a Difficult (–2)
Comms check and, if successful, a single attacking smart missile ceases
attacking. The sensors operator may continue making checks to disable
smart missiles until he fails one, with a cumulative –1 DM each time.

### Evasive Manuevers

The pilot operates the vessel in an erratic manner in an attempt to
avoid being hit by opposing weapons fire. The Pilot makes an Average(+0)
Pilot skill. If successful, any attack rolls targeting the pilot's
vessel suffer a DM-1 penalty, or DM-2 with an Exceptional Success.

### Increase Initiative

The Captain of a vessel may make a Leadership check and increase the
Initiative of his vessel by the Effect of the check. This increase only
applies for the following turn.

### Intercept Enemy Communications

The sensors operator may attempt to intercept enemy communications. This
requires a Difficult(-2) Comms skill check. Encryption (if any) must
also be broken. Knowledge of enemy intentions can be valuable to a
Captain, if they know how to use it. The Captain may make an Easy (+4)
Tactics check to gain an advantage from intercepted communications. If
successful, the Captain gains knowledge of the enemy’s dispositions or
intentions. This translates to a one-time DM+4 bonus to any skill check
affecting the enemy (e.g. a pilot’s attempt to evade a sudden attack, or
a gunner’s precise shot just as the enemy vessel turns to present a
better target.) Of course, the enemy must have communications for them
to be intercepted.

### Line Up the Shot

A pilot may attempt to aid his gunners by providing a stable firing
platform along an optimum attack vector. The pilot makes a Pilot check
to aid his gunners, granting a DM+1 on all attacks rolls this turn with
a success, or a DM+2 with an Exceptional Success.

### Maintain Communications

The sensors operator can establish and maintain communications between
allied vessels with a Routine(+2) Comms skill check. If there is
significant interference or a lot of communications going on (e.g. due
to bad comm. discipline among a fleet), treat as Considerable Noise
(DM-2). Deliberate comms jamming requires an opposed Comms skill check
with the jammer. If reliable communications are not established, vessels
cannot act in concert, and Tactics skill cannot be applied.

### Pursuit

If a pilot makes a successful opposed Pilot skill check against another
vessel within Short or Close range travelling at the same speed as the
pilot's vessel, the successful pilot has placed his vessel in pursuit of
his target maintaining the current range and matching the target ship
move for move. Once a pursuit has been established, it must be
maintained each turn to take advantage of the position. Maintaining a
pursuit is a significant action that does not require a skill check. It
is automatically maintained unless the target succeeds at the Break
Pursuit action, manages to extend the range between the vessels to
Medium or greater, or succeeds in outpacing the speed of the pursuing
vessel by 7+ points. For each turn (after the first) that a vessel
maintains pursuit of another vessel, it gains a cumulative DM+1 to hit
when attacking the vessel being pursued, up to a maximum of DM+4.

### Ram

Ramming is a potentially suicidal maneuver in which a pilot
intentionally crashes his vessel into the hull of another vessel. This
action may only be attempted at Close range, and if the ramming vessel
is moving faster than the target. To successfully ram another vessel
requires an opposed Pilot skill check between both vessels. A collision
inflicts 1D6 damage for every point of difference in speed between the
two vessels.

### Range Check

The Navigator makes an opposed Navigation skill check with another
vessel. The vessel with the highest result may elect to increase,
decrease, or maintain the range between the vessels for the round.

### Reload Weapons System

A crew member (usually the gunner) may spend the round reloading one
spent missile rack, one spent sandcaster or other individual weapon
system.

### Repair Damaged System

A character on damage control may attempt to repair a damaged system by
making an Education-based Mechanics check. If the check is successful,
determine how many hits are repaired:

#### Table: Damage Repair Results

| Mechanics Check Effect | Hits Repaired |
|------------------------|---------------|
| 0                      | 1             |
| 1–5                    | 2             |
| 6+                     | 3             |

A ship with repair drones and the Auto-Repair software also makes one or
two repair checks on the vessel's turn (unless it is being used to
assist other repair attempts). The standard Auto-Repair software makes
the check with a +1 DM. These are battlefield repairs only and will
break down as soon as the battle is over unless repaired properly.

### Sensor Targeting

The sensors operator may attempt to spend the turn providing improved
fire control and targeting data to the gunners, hopefully increasing
their chances of hitting their targets. The sensors operator should make
a Education-based Comms skill check against the target's Sensor Jamming
rating, for each vessel that is to targeted. If successful, all gunners
on the vessel gain a DM+1 bonus to their attacks this turn, or a DM+2 on
an Exceptional Success. When using missiles the initial attack gets this
bonus – the individual missile to hit rolls do not benefit directly.
Smart missiles are unaffected.

### Miscellaneous 

A character may make a skill check or do something else as a significant
action when such an action requires the character's full attention,
concentration, complicated physical actions or some combination thereof.
Any skill check with a time interval of 1-6 minutes is simply considered
a significant action during space combat.

## Reactions

As in Personal Combat, reactions are actions taken immediately in
response to the action of another. A ship may react to incoming attacks.
The following situations allow reactions:

- Targeted by a beam attack

- Incoming missile

- Attempted boarding

The ship's Initiative determines how many times it may react in a round.

#### Table: Reactions By Initiative

| Initiative | Reactions |
|------------|-----------|
| 0–4        | 1         |
| 5–8        | 2         |
| 9–12       | 3         |
| 13+        | 4         |

### Dodge Incoming Fire

To dodge, the pilot must make a Pilot check. If successful, the attack
suffers a –2 DM.

### Fire Sand

Turrets equipped with sandcasters can fire sand at incoming beam
attacks. Each reaction spent on firing sand allows the gunner to make a
Turret Weapons roll. If successful the damage of each beam in the
incoming attack is reduced by 1D6. Resolve each beam separately. Each
firing of sand costs one canister of sand. Sand can also be directed
against incoming boarding parties. If the sand attack is successful,
each target in the boarding party takes 8D6 damage.

### Point Defense 

Turret lasers can be used to destroy incoming missiles. The missiles can
only be destroyed in the moments before they strike the spacecraft as
they are too small and fast-moving to effectively target at greater
ranges. The gunner must make a Turret Weapons check against the missile.
If successful, the missile is destroyed. A gunner may keep making Turret
Weapons checks against missiles until he misses an attack; each attack
suffers a cumulative –1 penalty. Attacks may be directed against
different incoming missiles. Point defense can also be used to attack
incoming boarders in the same way.

### Trigger Screens 

Screens can be activated as long as the commander or one of the gunners
has the Screens skill at Level 0 and the ship has the required screen
type (nuclear against nuclear missiles and fusion guns; meson against
meson guns). Screens reduce the damage from the attack by 2D6+the
operator's Screens skill. Nuclear dampers also remove the automatic
radiation hit from nuclear missile attacks.

## Other Actions

Other types of action can take place during space combat.

### Free Actions 

Some actions are so fast on the scale of space combat that they do not
even qualify as a minor action. A character can perform as many of these
free actions as he likes in a turn, although if he performs several the
Referee may require him to spend a minor or even a significant action on
his various tasks.

### Extended Actions 

Some skill checks will take longer than a single combat turn to
complete. Make a Timing roll for the task and then work out how many six
minute combat turns it will take to complete. A character engaging in an
extended action cannot do anything else but can abandon their action at
any time and return to the normal Initiative order. A character who is
hit by an attack while undertaking an extended action must make an 8+
roll using the skill in question with a negative DM equal to the amount
of damage the attack causes (after armor). Failure indicates that this
turn's work does not count towards the completion of the task. Failure
by six or more (an Exceptional Failure) ruins the task and the character
must start again.

### Delay 

A vessel does not have to act when its turn comes up in the Initiative
order. The Captain may decide to act at any later point during the turn,
even interrupting another's actions to do so. When he acts, his
Initiative is set to the count on which he acted. If the character has
not acted by the end of the turn he may choose to act first in the next
turn, effectively giving up his actions in the previous turn in exchange
for an Initiative advantage. His new Initiative is set to one higher
than that of the current first person in the order. When multiple
characters are delaying and all wish to act first in the following turn,
their Initiatives are all set to the same score and they act in order of
Thrust as normal.

## Special Considerations 

The following are special considerations in space combat.

### Abstract Boarding Rules

In circumstances when the Referee may wish to resolve a boarding action
without resorting to the personal combat rules, the following
alternative method is suggested. On each round of a boarding action, the
attacking Chief Security Officer (or Captain, if the CSO is down or not
appointed) makes an opposed Intelligence-based Tactics skill check
against the Chief Security Officer (or Captain, if the CSO is down or
not appointed) of the defenders. The results of each round depend on who
wins and the degree of success achieved by the winner of the opposed
check, as outlined in the Abstract Boarding Resolution table.

####

</tr>

</table>

### Missiles

Unlike beam weapons, which travel at the speed of light and so hit the
enemy vessel almost instantly, missile weapons take time to cross the
gulf of space. Missiles travel at Thrust 10 towards their designated
target and their position can either be tracked as additional craft in
the battle or, for the sake of simplicity, they can be assumed to strike
after a number of turns dependent on launch range, as shown in the
Missile Launch Range table. Missiles cannot be used at Adjacent or Close
range.

#### Table: Missile Launch Range

| Range     | Turns to Impact |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Adjacent  | \-              |
| Close     | \-              |
| Short     | 1               |
| Medium    | 1               |
| Long      | 1               |
| Very Long | 2               |
| Distant   | 2               |

When the missile is launched, the gunner must make a Turret Weapons or
Bay Weapons skill check to determine the accuracy of the launch. The
effect of the skill check determines the chance that the missile will
strike its target when it hits. A target may react to incoming missiles
by dodging or point defense. This reaction does not take place until the
turn the missiles arrive at their destination, so any target response
must wait until then.

#### Table: Missile To-Hit By Skill Check Effect

| Turret Weapons/Bay Weapons check | Missile to-hit roll |     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|-----|
| Failed With Effect –6 or less    | 11+                 |     |
| Failed With Effect –1 to –5      | 10+                 |     |
| Succeeded With Effect 0          | 8+                  |     |
| Succeeded With Effect 1–5        | 7+                  |     |
| Succeeded With Effect 6+         | 6+                  |     |

#### 

#### 

#### Smart Missiles

The missile to-hit roll for smart missiles is always 8+ and if they miss
they make another attack every turn until they are destroyed with point
defense, jammed with ECM, run out of fuel or otherwise dissuaded.

### Planetary Maneuvers

Within close range of a planet, certain planetary maneuvers become
possible.

**Orbital Insertion**: The pilot may attempt to insert the ship into
orbit around a planet. In an orbital insertion fails, the ship fails to
enter the proper orbit, and the orbit will steadily begin to decay
drawing the ship towards the planet’s atmosphere in an uncontrolled
reentry (see Atmospheric Reentry below). This is a significant action
requiring a Routine(+2) Pilot skill check.

**Atmospheric Entry**: The pilot may attempt to transition the ship out
of orbit and into the atmosphere of a planet. This is a significant
action with an Average (+0) Pilot skill check, with any applicable DMs
from the Atmospheric Entry table. Exotic, Corrosive, or Insidious
atmospheres should be treated as Standard unless specified otherwise.

#### Table: Atmospheric Entry

| World Values                | DM           |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| World Size 9+               | -2           |
| World Size 4 or less        | +2           |
| World Atmosphere 1 or less  | Auto Success |
| World Atmosphere 2-5, 14(E) | +2           |
| World Atmosphere 8-9, 13(D) | -2           |

### Special Weapon Rules

Several types of weapons have their own rules.

- **Meson Guns**: Meson guns ignore armor and always roll on the
  Internal Damage table. Furthermore, they also automatically inflict a
  radiation crew hit in addition to any other damage.

- **Fusion Guns**: Fusion guns inflict a radiation crew hit in addition
  to any other damage. The bonus radiation hit suffers a –DM equal to
  the ship's armor.

- **Particle Beams**: Particle beams inflict a radiation crew hit in
  addition to any other damage. The bonus radiation hit suffers a –DM
  equal to the ship's armor.

- **Nuclear Missiles**: Nuclear missile hits inflict a radiation crew
  hit in addition to their normal damage. The bonus radiation hit
  suffers a –DM equal to the ship's armor.

- **Sandcasters**: While the primary purpose of a sandcaster is to block
  incoming beam attacks, they can also be used as an attack. A
  sandcaster has a range of Close and inflicts 1 point of damage.

## Damage

Systems can take a variable number of hits before being destroyed,
depending on the system in question. A ship can endure one point of Hull
damage per fifty tons, rounding down. A ship that runs out of Hull
Damage will rapidly be incapacitated. A ship can endure one point of
Structure damage per fifty tons, rounding down to a minimum of one. A
ship that runs out of Structure breaks up and is completely destroyed.

The effects of damage are determined by subtracting the ship's armor
from the damage rolled by the weapon, then consulting the Space Combat
Damage table to determine the number of hits inflicted. Then roll on the
Space Combat Hit Location table for each hit. Small craft use the Small
craft column. Vessels of 100 tons or larger use the External Hit
(Vessel) column until a ship has suffered enough damage to wipe out its
Hull, and then uses the Internal Hit (Vessel) column. A double hit
applies two hits to the same location. A triple hit applies three hits
to the same location.

# BOOK THREE: REFEREES

# CHAPTER 11: ENVIRONMENTS AND HAZARDS

The following are common environmental hazards that are can be
encountered in a Märchen Engine game.

## Acid

Corrosive acids deal 1D6 damage per round of exposure, except in the
case of total immersion (such as into a vat of acid), which deals 10D6
damage per round. An attack with acid, such as from a hurled vial or an
animal's acidic spittle, counts as a round of exposure.

The fumes from most acids are poisonous. Those who come close enough to
a large body of acid to dunk a creature in it must make an Average (+0)
Endurance check or take 1D6 point of damage. All such characters must
make a second Average (+0) Endurance check one minute later or take
another 1D6 point of damage.

Creatures that are immune to acid's caustic properties might still drown
in it if they are totally immersed and need to breathe. For more
details, see **Suffocation**.

## Carrying Capacity

Strength determines how much weight characters can lift and how much any
additional encumbrance slows them down. Characters carrying more than
their Light Load suffer penalties.

**Light Load**: As a light load, a character can life and carry up to
twice their Strength characteristic score in kilograms without any
penalties or difficulties. For example, an average character with a
Strength score of 7 can carry up to 14 kilograms as a light load.

**Medium Load**: A medium load is considered to be twice a character's
light load, or four times their Strength characteristic score in
kilograms. Characters carrying a medium load suffer a DM-1 to all
physically based checks, including skill checks. In addition, they move
at 75% of their base speed. For example, an average character with a
Strength score of 7 can carry up to 28 kilograms as a medium load. Such
a character would suffer a DM-1 on all physical checks, and move at 4.5
meters, or 3 squares, per round.

**Heavy Load**: A heavy load is three times the character's light load,
or six times their Strength characteristic score in kilograms.
Characters can lift up to a heavy load overhead. Characters carrying a
heavy load suffer a DM-2 to all physically based checks, including skill
checks. In addition, they move at 75% of their base speed. For example,
an average character with a Strength score of 7 can lift up to 42
kilograms as a heavy load. Such a character would suffer a DM-2 on all
physical checks, and move at 4.5 meters, or 3 squares, per round.

**Maximum Load**: A character's maximum load is six times that of their
light load, or twelve times their Strength score in kilograms.
Characters can lift up to the maximum load off the ground, but can only
stagger around with it. While overloaded in this way, characters cannot
undertake any other actions, and can only move 1.5 meters, or 1 square,
per round. For example, an average character with a Strength score of 7
can barely lift up to 94 kilograms as a maximum load. Such a character
could perform no other actions while struggling with the load, except to
move 1.5 meters per round.

**Push/Drag**: Characters can push or drag up to five times their heavy
load weight, moving at half their normal speed. Favorable conditions
(smooth ground, dragging a slick object) double these numbers, and bad
circumstances (broken ground, pushing an object that snags) can reduce
them to one-half or less.

### Gravity and Carrying Capacity

The above assumes the character is operating at a standard 1.0 gravity.
When operating under a different gravitational pull (or within an
artificial gravity set to a non-standard value), simply divide a
character's load weight by the gravitational pull to determine the new
load weight value under those conditions.

## Diseases

Diseases reduce a character’s Characteristics, usually Endurance. The
character must make an Endurance check with the listed DM to resist the
effects of the disease. If the character fails the Endurance check then
he takes the listed damage and must make another Endurance check a few
hours or days later, depending on the interval of the disease. Once an
Endurance check has been passed, the character has fought off the
disease.

#### Table: Sample Diseases

| Disease           | DM  | Damage | Interval  |
|-------------------|-----|--------|-----------|
| Pneumonia         | +0  | 1D6+4  | 1D6 weeks |
| Anthrax           | –3  | 1D6+2  | 1D6 days  |
| Regina Flu        | +1  | 1D6–2  | 1D6 days  |
| Biological Weapon | –6  | 1D6+8  | 1D6 hours |

## Extremes of Temperature

Unusually hot or cold worlds can cause damage unless the characters are
suitably protected. Temperatures are in Celsius.

#### Table: Extreme Temperatures

| Temperature | Damage    | Example                  |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Below -200˚ | 3D6/round | Absolute Zero, Pluto     |
| -200˚       | 2D6/round | Liquid nitrogen, Neptune |
| -100˚       | 1D6/round | Ceres                    |
| -50˚        | 2D6/hour  | Mars                     |
| -25˚        | 1D6/hour  | Arctic                   |
| 0˚          | None      | Water melting point      |
| 50˚         | 1D6/hour  | Very hot desert          |
| 100˚        | 2D6/hour  | Water boiling point      |
| 200˚        | 1D6/round | Mercury                  |
| 500˚        | 2D6/round | Venus                    |
| Above 500˚  | 3D6/round | Surface of the sun       |

### Catching on Fire

Characters touching a fire source might find their clothes, hair, or
equipment on fire. Those at risk of catching fire are allowed a
Difficult (-2) Dexterity check to avoid this fate. If a character's
clothes or hair catch fire, he takes 2D6 damage immediately. In each
subsequent round, the burning character must make another Difficult (-2)
Dexterity check. Failure means he takes another 2D6 damage that round.
Success means the fire has gone out.

A character on fire may automatically extinguish the flames by jumping
into enough water to douse himself, spraying himself down with a fire
extinguisher, vent all atmosphere or otherwise smother the flames. If
the character has no such means, rolling on the ground or smothering the
fire with cloaks or the like permits the character a DM+2 on his next
Dexterity check.

## Falling and Gravity

A character who falls on a 1-gravity world suffers 1D6 damage per two
meters fallen. High- or low-gravity worlds will increase or decrease the
damage. Look up the size code for the world and the gravity level
associated with it and multiply the falling damage by the gravity
number.

## Poisons

Poisons operate in the same way as diseases, but generally work much
faster and often have a wider range of effects. Most poisons do not have
an interval but apply their damage immediately.

#### Table: Sample Poisons

| Poison     | DM   | Damage                                       |
|------------|------|----------------------------------------------|
| Arsenic    | –2   | 2D6                                          |
| Tranq Gas  | –1D6 | Unconsciousness if Endurance check is failed |
| Neurotoxin | –4   | 1D6 Intelligence                             |

## Radiation Exposure

Radiation exposure is measured in rads. Once a character has absorbed a
certain number of rads, he will suffer certain effects. One problem with
radiation exposure is that while physical symptoms can be treated and
may heal, the radiation never goes away. The character’s rads must be
tracked. Further exposure adds to what the character is already carrying
around until a deadly level is reached. Accumulated rads can be removed
using anti-radiation drugs. Characters exposed to a radiation weapon
will receive a one-time dose of radiation. Entering a radioactive area
or being exposed to a leak or solar flare will cause exposure each round
or hour. Every time a character experiences exposure to radiation, they
must check to see if they’ve come down with radiation sickness, as
outlined on the Radiation Effects table. The character must make an
Endurance check at the listed DM, and if he fails, he takes the damage
listed and must make another Endurance check after the listed interval
has passed. This cycle continues until the character succeeds at an
Endurance check.

At any Radiation Level below Mild, the character is treated as having a
lower Endurance characteristic score. If a character should accumulate
enough rads to move to a higher Radiation Level, the new Endurance
characteristic score immediately goes into effect. On the other hand, if
a character moves to a lower Radiation Level, such as through
anti-radiation drugs, the character heals the difference between the
former level and the current level over time, as if it were physical
damage. If a character’s Effective endurance falls below zero, the
character goes unconscious and cannot recover until their Radiation
Level drops enough to allow healing to take place.

#### Table: Common Radiation Exposure Sources

| Situation                       | Instant (rads) | Extended (rads) |
|---------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Irradiated area, low level      | --             | 1D6/hour        |
| Irradiated area, moderate level | --             | 2D6/hour        |
| Irradiated area, high level     | --             | 6D6/hour        |
| Irradiated area, severe level   | --             | 12D6/hour       |
| Active exposure, low level      | 3D6            | 3D6x10/hour     |
| Active exposure, moderate level | 1D6x10         | 1D6x100/hour    |
| Active exposure, high level     | 2D6x10         | 2D6x100/hour    |
| Active exposure, severe level   | 4D6x10         | 3D6x100/hour    |

#### Table: Radiation Effects

| Radiation Level | Rads    | Effective Endurance | DM   | Damage | Interval  |
|-----------------|---------|---------------------|------|--------|-----------|
| Mild            | \<100   | --                  | None | None   | None      |
| Low             | 100-199 | Endurance-1         | +1   | 1D6    | 1D6 weeks |
| Moderate        | 200-599 | Endurance-3         | +0   | 1D6+2  | 2D6 days  |
| High            | 600-999 | Endurance-6         | -1   | 1D6+4  | 1D6 days  |
| Severe          | 1000+   | Endurance-10        | -2   | 1D6+6  | 1D6 hours |

## Starvation and Dehydration

Characters might find themselves without food or water and with no means
to obtain them. In normal climates, a character needs at least a gallon
of fluids and about a pound of food per day to avoid starvation. In very
hot climates, characters need two or three times as much water to avoid
dehydration.

A character can go without water for a number of hours equal to 20 plus
twice his Endurance score. After this time, the character must make a
Routine (+2) Endurance check each hour (DM-1 for each previous check) or
take 1D6 damage.

A character can go without food for 3 days, in growing discomfort. After
this time, the character must make a Routine (+2) Endurance check each
day (DM-1 for each previous check) or take 1D6 damage.

Damage from thirst or starvation cannot be recovered until the character
gets food or water.

## Suffocation

In an area where sufficient oxygen is not long available, such as on
board a starship without life support, a character begins to suffocate,
suffering 1D6 damage each minute. A character who is utterly without air
(such as one who is being smothered or strangled, or who has been dumped
out an airlock) suffers 1D6 damage each round instead.

## Vacuum Exposure

Beings exposed to the airless cold of space are not immediately doomed.
Contrary to popular belief, characters exposed to vacuum do not
immediately freeze or explode, and their blood does not boil in their
veins. While space is very cold, heat does not transfer away from a body
that quickly. The real danger comes from suffocation and ionizing
radiation.

On the third round of exposure to vacuum, a character must succeed on a
Very Difficult (-4) Endurance check each round or suffer from
aeroembolism ("the bends"). A character that fails the check experiences
excruciating pain as small air bubbles form in its bloodstream; such a
character is considered stunned and generally unable to move, and
remains so until returned to normal atmospheric pressure. A character
that fails the check with an Exceptional Failure (Effect -6 or lower)
falls unconscious.

The real danger of vacuum comes from suffocation, though holding one's
breath in vacuum damages the lungs. Treat anyone trapped in a hard
vacuum as being utterly without air under the **Suffocation** rules.

Unfiltered radiation bombards any character trapped in the vacuum of
space without protective gear. A character exposed to this ionizing
radiation suffers from severe sunburn as well as the effects equivalent
to a high level irradiated area. See **Radiation Exposure** for specific
details.

## Weather

Driving wind, rain, snowstorms and so forth give a –1 DM to ranged
attacks from poor visibility and a –1 DM to ranged attacks from
environmental interference. Sensors can be used to avoid the visibility
penalty. Extremely high winds and torrential rain can inflict a negative
Dice Modifier of –1 to –4 to all skill checks.

# CHAPTER 12: WORLDS

The basic planetary characteristics are Size, Atmosphere, Hydrology,
Population, Government, Law Level, Technology Level, Starport and Bases,
and are generated using two-dice throws, with DMs applied based on other
characteristics. These characteristics establish the basic identity of a
world, and are referred to as the Universal World Profile (UWP).
Additional information can be generated, and should be, to more fully
describe a world.

## The Universal World Profile (UWP)

The Märchen Engine utilizes a concise one-line coding to encapsulate
data on an individual world in a manner that, with a little practice,
can be quickly and easily read. The specifics of the Universal World
Profile can be found below:

WorldName 0000 A123456-7x Ni R 123 Na

### The Explanation

“**WorldName**” indicates the common name for the world that is being
profiled.

“**0000**” provides the location of the world’s hex (column, then row)
on the sector or subsector map.

“**A123456-7**” is the classic world profile. Each number or letter is a
pseudo-hexadecimal code representing a specific value on the
corresponding world data charts. In order, the profile defines the
following elements: Starport, World Size, Atmosphere, Hydrographics,
Population, Government, Law Level, followed by a hyphen and finally
Technology Level.

“**X**” indicates where information about a world’s bases are noted. A
space here indicates that the world has no bases worthy of note on an
interstellar level.

“**Ni**” is used here to indicate where special remarks and trade codes
are displayed as part of the world data profile.

“**R**” provides information about the world’s Travel Zone
classification. A space indicates a world that is generally safe to
visit. An “A” represents an Amber Zone, indicating a world that
adventurers should approach with more caution than normal. An “R”
indicates a Red Zone, a world where travel is prohibited for any of a
number of reasons, from physical dangers to political secrecy.

“**123**” represents a brief synopsis of three pieces of data: a
Population Multiplier for the main world, the number of Planetoid Belts
in the system, and the number of Gas Giants in the system.

“**Na**” indicates the system’s interstellar allegiance. “Na” is used
for non-aligned worlds.

## Star Mapping

For Märchen Engine universes, the presence of star systems is marked on
hex maps, each hex representing one parsec. For each system, generate a
Universal World Profile for the primary world of the system. The
smallest astrogation map size, the subsector, measures 8 hexes wide by
10 hexes high. An intermediate map size, the quadrant, measures two
subsectors by two subsectors, while the largest map size, the sector,
measures two quadrants by two quadrants.

There is a basic one-half chance normally that a world (and its
attendant stellar system) will be in a hex. Systematically check each
hex on the subsector map, throwing one die and marking the hex with a
circle if the result is a 4, 5, or 6. This indicates that a world is
present; otherwise, leave the hex blank. The Referee may elect to alter
the normal chances of worlds, making them more frequent or less frequent
to correspond to specific regions of the galaxy. A 50% density (no DM)
is appropriate for the spiral arms of the galaxy. Apply a –2 DM for
‘rift sectors’, a –1 DM for sparse sectors and a +1 DM for densely
populated sectors.

## World Size

The Size characteristic for inhabitable worlds ranges from 0 to 10, and
is determined by rolling 2D6–2.

#### Table: World Size

| Digit  | World Size                     | Surface Gravity (gs) |
|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| 0      | 800 km (typically an asteroid) | Negligible           |
| 1      | 1,600 km                       | 0.05                 |
| 2      | 3,200 km                       | 0.15                 |

| 4      | 6,400 km                       | 0.35                 |
| 5      | 8,000 km                       | 0.45                 |
| 6      | 9,600 km                       | 0.7                  |
| 7      | 11,200 km                      | 0.9                  |
| 8      | 12,800 km                      | 1.0                  |
| 9      | 14,400 km                      | 1.25                 |
| 10 (A) | 16,000 km                      | 1.4                  |

### High and Low Gravity Worlds

Worlds where the gravity is 0.75 or less are low-gravity worlds. Common
features include improbable-looking rock formations, thin and spindly
life forms and flying as a common form of locomotion (assuming the
atmosphere is thick enough to support flyers). Humans tend to find life
on low-gravity worlds to be initially pleasant, but regular exercise
regimes and medicinal supplements are required to prevent bone and
muscle degradation. Those who spent too long on low-gravity worlds
cannot tolerate higher gravities. Characters on low-gravity worlds
suffer a –1 DM to all skill checks until they acclimatize, a process
which takes 1D6 weeks. Characters with the Zero-G skill at level 0 or
better acclimatize instantly.

High-gravity worlds have a gravity 1.25 times or more than of Earth.
They tend to be extremely dense worlds; common features include wide
rocky plains, squat, muscular creatures, and plant life that spreads out
like lichen instead of growing up. Crawling, burrowing or swimming are
the commonest forms of locomotion. Humans find high-gravity worlds
unpleasant. Especially high-gravity worlds require the use of pressured
or powered suits to support the human frame. Characters on high-gravity
worlds suffer a –1 DM to all skill checks until they acclimatize, a
process which takes 1D6 weeks.

## Atmosphere

A planet’s Atmosphere is generated by rolling 2D6–7 and adding the
planet’s Size. If a world's Size equals 0, then the world's Atmosphere
equals 0. The Atmosphere code should never be higher than 15(F).

#### Table: Atmosphere

| Digit  | Atmosphere         | Pressure      | Survival Gear Required |
|--------|--------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 0      | None               | 0.00          | Vacc Suit              |
| 1      | Trace              | 0.001 to 0.09 | Vacc Suit              |

| 3      | Very Thin          | 0.1 to 0.42   | Respirator             |
| 4      | Thin, Tainted      | 0.43 to 0.7   | Filter                 |
| 5      | Thin               | 0.43 to 0.7   |                        |
| 6      | Standard           | 0.71–1.49     |                        |
| 7      | Standard, Tainted  | 0.71–1.49     | Filter                 |
| 8      | Dense              | 1.5 to 2.49   |                        |
| 9      | Dense, Tainted     | 1.5 to 2.49   | Filter                 |
| 10 (A) | Exotic             | Varies        | Air Supply             |
| 11 (B) | Corrosive          | Varies        | Vacc Suit              |
| 12 (C) | Insidious          | Varies        | Vacc Suit              |
| 13 (D) | Dense, High        | 2.5+          |                        |
| 14 (E) | Thin, Low          | 0.5 or less   |                        |
| 15 (F) | Unusual            | Varies        | Varies                 |

### Atmosphere Types

**Tainted**: Tainted atmospheres contain some element that is harmful to
humans, such as an unusually high proportion of carbon dioxide. A
character who breathes a tainted atmosphere without a filter will suffer
1D6 damage every few minutes (or hours, depending on the level of
taint).

**Exotic**: An exotic atmosphere is unbreathable by humans, but is not
otherwise hazardous. A character needs an air supply to breath in an
exotic atmosphere.

**Corrosive**: Corrosive atmospheres are highly dangerous. A character
who breathes in a corrosive atmosphere will suffer 1D6 damage each
round.

**Insidious**: An insidious atmosphere is like a corrosive one, but it
is so corrosive that it attacks equipment as well. The chief danger in
an insidious atmosphere is that the toxic gases will destroy the seals
and filters on the character’s protective gear. An insidious atmosphere
worms its way past protection after 2D6 hours on average, although
vigilant maintenance or advanced protective gear can prolong survival
times.

**Dense, High** (D): These worlds have thick N2/O2 atmospheres, but
their mean surface pressure is too high to support unprotected human
life (high pressure nitrogen and oxygen are deadly to humans). However,
pressure naturally decreases with increasing altitude, so if there are
highlands at the right altitude the pressure may drop enough to support
human life. Alternatively, there may not be any topography high enough
for humans to inhabit, necessitating floating gravitic or dirigible
habitats or sealed habitats on the surface.

**Thin, Low** (E): The opposite of the Dense, High atmosphere, these
massive worlds have thin N2/O2 atmospheres that settle in the lowlands
and depressions and are only breathable there – the pressure drops off
so rapidly with altitude that the highest topographic points of the
surface may be close to vacuum.

**Unusual** (F): An Unusual atmosphere is a catchall term for an
atmosphere that behaves in a strange manner. Examples include
ellipsoidal atmospheres, which are thin at the poles and dense at the
equator; Panthalassic worlds composed of a rocky core surrounded by a
water layer hundreds of kilometers thick; worlds wracked by storms so
intense that that the local air pressure changes from dense to thin
depending on the current weather; and other planets with unusual and
hazardous atmospheric conditions.

## Hydrographics

Hydrographic percentage is obtained by rolling 2D6–7 and adding the
world’s Size, modified by the world’s atmosphere or size as described in
the Hydrographic DMs by Size and Atmosphere table.

#### Table: Hydrographic DMs by Size and Atmosphere

| Condition                  | DM                      |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Size 0 or 1                | Hydrographics must be 0 |
| Atmosphere 0, 1, A, B or C | –4                      |
| Atmosphere E               | –2                      |

A world's Hydrographics value should never exceed 10 (A), nor may it be
lower than 0.

#### Table: Hydrographics

| Digit  | Hydrographic Percentage | Description                                |
|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0      | 0%–5%                   | Desert world                               |
| 1      | 6%–15%                  | Dry world                                  |
| 2      | 16%–25%                 | A few small seas.                          |
| 3      | 26%–35%                 | Small seas and oceans.                     |
| 4      | 36%–45%                 | Wet world                                  |
| 5      | 46%–55%                 | Large oceans                               |
| 6      | 56%–65%                 |                                            |
| 7      | 66%–75%                 | Earth-like world                           |
| 8      | 76%–85%                 | Water world                                |
| 9      | 86%–95%                 | Only a few small islands and archipelagos. |
| 10 (A) | 96–100%                 | Almost entirely water.                     |

## World Population

A world's Population is generated by rolling 2D6–2, modified by the
world’s Size, Atmosphere and Hydrographics as described in the
Population DMs table. A world's Population value should never exceed 10
(A). If a world has a population of 0, it is uninhabited and the world
also has a Government, Law Level and Technology Level of 0.

#### Table: Population DMs

| Condition                                     | DM  |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----|
| Size is 2 or less                             | -1  |
| Atmosphere is A or greater                    | -2  |
| Atmosphere is 6                               | +3  |
| Atmosphere is 5 or 8                          | +1  |
| Hydrographics is 0 and Atmosphere less than 3 | -2  |

### Population Modifier

Sometimes it is enough just to know that a world has hundreds of
millions of people on it (Population 8). Other times, a Referee or
player may want a more specific number. The Population Modifier is
determined by rolling 2D6-2. If the Population is greater than 0, the
minimum Population Modifier value is 1. If the Population code is 0,
then the Population Modifier is also 0. The Population Modifier is
multiplied by 10 raised to the power of the Population code to determine
a more specific number of people living on the world. For example, if
the Referee generates a Population Modifier of 4 for a world with a
Population code of 8, then he knows that (**4**x10**<sup>8</sup>**,
which is…) 400,000,000 people live on that world.

## Primary Starport

Many worlds have starports, their presence being essential to
interstellar trade and commerce. To determine the world’s primary
starport, roll 2D6-7 and add the world’s Population value. Compare the
result to the Primary Starport table to determine the starport class for
the world. Each starport class offers different levels of service. The
Starport Class Services table provides more specific details.

#### Table: Primary Starport

| Roll      | Starport Class |
|-----------|----------------|
| 2 or less | X              |
| 3         | E              |

## World Government

The Government characteristic is determined by rolling 2D6–7 and adding
the world’s Population. If a world's Population equals 0, then the
world's Government equals 0. The Government code should never be higher
than 15(F), nor lower than 0.

#### Table: World Government

| Type   | Government                  |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| 0      | None                        |
| 1      | Company/Corporation         |
| 2      | Participating Democracy     |
| 3      | Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy |
| 4      | Representative Democracy    |
| 5      | Feudal Technocracy          |
| 6      | Captive Government          |
| 7      | Balkanization               |
| 8      | Civil Service Bureaucracy   |
| 9      | Impersonal Bureaucracy      |
| 10 (A) | Charismatic Dictator        |
| 11 (B) | Non-Charismatic Leader      |
| 12 (C) | Charismatic Oligarchy       |
| 13 (D) | Religious Dictatorship      |
| 14 (E) | Religious Autocracy         |
| 15 (F) | Totalitarian Oligarchy      |

## Law Level

Law level is determined by rolling 2D6–7 and adding the Government
characteristic. If the world’s Government is 0, then the world’s Law
Level is also 0. Law Level should never be less than 0.

#### Table: Law Level

| Digit  | Descriptor  | Not Allowed                                                               |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | No Law      | No restrictions; candidate for Amber Zone status                          |

| 7      | High Law    | Shotguns                                                                  |
| 8      | High Law    | All bladed weapons, stunners                                              |
| 9      | High Law    | Any weapons outside one’s residence; candidate for Amber Zone status      |
| 10(A)+ | Extreme Law | Any weapons allowed at all; candidate for Amber Zone status               |

## Technology Level

The Technology Level (also called “tech level” or TL) of the world is
determined by rolling 1D6 and adding DMs per the Technology Level DMs by
UWP Values table. A world’s Technology Level may not be below 0.

#### Table: Technology Level DMs by UWP Values

| Value  | Starport | Size | Atmosphere | Hydrographics | Population | Government |
|--------|----------|------|------------|---------------|------------|------------|
| 0      |          | +2   | +1         | +1            |            | +1         |
| 1      |          | +2   | +1         |               | +1         |            |

Certain world conditions must meet a minimum Technology Level
requirement. If the world possesses a lower technology level, then the
Referee should increase the world’s tech level to the required minimum.

#### Table: Technology Level Minimums

| Conditions                                            | Minimum TL |

| Atmosphere is 13(D) or 14(E), Hydrographics is 10(A)  | 7          |

## Trade Codes

Trade codes are assigned based on a world’s UWP values, as noted in the
UWP Values for Trade Codes table.

## Planetoid Belt Presence

Planetoid belts exist in many systems, and are mined by belters for ice,
ore and other interesting things. To determine the presence of planetoid
belts in a given star system, throw 4+ on 2D6 for at least one planetoid
belt to be present in the system. If planetoid belts are present, then
the number of planetoid belts in the system is 1D6-3, minimum of 1. If
the primary world of the system is Size 0, then there’s at least one
planetoid belt in the system automatically.

## Gas Giant Presence

A star system may have one or more gas giant planets. The presence of a
gas giant allows starships equipped with fuel scoops to refuel by
skimming; this eliminates fuel cost for the vessel and increases profit.
It also allows refueling at systems that do not have starports.
Refueling in this fashion requires 1D6 hours per 40 tons of fuel.

Gas giants are relatively common. For each system throw 5+ on 2D6 for at
least one gas giant to be present in the system. If gas giants are
present, then the number of gas giants in the system is 1D6-2, minimum
of 1.

## Bases

Stellar systems may have bases for military forces, the navy, the
scouts, or for other arms of interstellar government. Bases can help
determine political boundaries within a given region of space. An
interstellar government will place bases along its borders to guard
against aggression from rival states, or to control local systems. The
presence of multiple bases within a few parsecs might indicate a
contested border, or a mighty stronghold. While other bases may exist,
the two primary bases are the Naval Base and the Scout Base.

### Naval Base

A naval base is a supply depot, refueling station, repair yard or
fortress of the Navy. Naval vessels can obtain refined fuel and supplies
here. If a world possesses a Class-A or Class-B starport, throw 8+ on
2D6 to determine the presence of a naval base in the system.

### Scout Base

A scout base or outpost offers refined fuel and supplies to scout ships.
If a world does not possess a Class-E or Class-X starport, throw 7+ on
2D6 to determine the presence of a scout base in the system. This roll
suffers a DM -1 if the world has a Class-C starport, a DM -2 for a
Class-B starport and a DM -3 for a Class-A starport.

### Pirate Base

A pirate base serves as a haven for interstellar pirates. If a world
does not possess a Class-A starport or a naval base, throw 12+ on 2D6 to
determine the presence of a pirate base in the system.

### Base Codes

The presence of one or more bases is designated on the hex map with a
base code in the upper-left of the world hex. The Base Codes table
identifies which note-worthy bases, if any, are present.

#### Table: Base Codes

| Code | Description                        |
|------|------------------------------------|
| A    | Naval Base and Scout Base/Outpost  |
| G    | Scout Base/Outpost and Pirate Base |
| N    | Naval Base                         |
| P    | Pirate Base                        |
| S    | Scout Base/Outpost                 |

## Travel Zones

Most worlds are assumed to be civilized, or at least amenable to
adventurers and other visitors. Some, however, are caught in the throes
of war, plagued by disease, or simply not ready for interstellar
visitors. Such worlds are classified by travel zones to denote such
status. In most cases, the Referee should indicate travel zones based on
the information available. Two such zone types exist: amber and red.

### Amber Zone

An Amber world has been deemed dangerous, and travelers are warned to be
on their guard. Amber worlds are often undergoing upheaval or
revolution, or else are naturally hazardous environments. A world with
an Atmosphere of 10+, a government of 0, 7 or 10, or a Law Level of 0 or
9+ should be considered for Amber status.

### Red Zone

Red worlds are interdicted and travel to them is forbidden.
Interdictions are enforced by the Navy. Red zones can indicate that the
world is too dangerous to allow visitors. The Referee assigns Red worlds
at his discretion.

## Polities and World Allegiance

Worlds may be independent, or part of a larger polity that spans a
system or more. Polities range from loose confederations of a few worlds
with common trade or defense policies or cultural links, to vast star
empires containing thousands of systems and trillions of citizens.
Polity borders should be drawn on the map. Note that larger polities
will usually have sub-domains, which should also be marked.

## Communications Routes and Trade Routes

Within the subsector, governments will have established communications
and trade routes connecting some (but not all) worlds. Messages between
businesses, governments and people generally follow these routes.

Communications routes should be carefully drawn so as to avoid making
all parts of the subsector accessible; a subsector should have some
areas as backwaters for exploration and adventure. Communications routes
are drawn as single lines connecting hexes on the subsector grid.

Trade routes link worlds that have strong commercial ties. Consult the
Trade Route Worlds table– if any pair of worlds matching the two columns
lay within four parsecs of each other, and there is a Jump–1 or Jump–2
route between them, then mark a trade route connecting those two worlds.

#### Table: Trade Route Worlds

| First End Point         | Second End Point                             |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Industrial or High Tech | Asteroid, Desert, Ice Capped, Non-Industrial |
| High Population or Rich | Agricultural, Garden, Water World            |

# CHAPTER 12.5 MONSTERS

Insidious beasts stalk the jungles and mountains. Horrors lurk deep
beneath the cities. And, of course, the natural world itself has a
bounty of creatures, ranging from the useful to the wondrous to the
terrible. Some of the most difficult and memorable opponents a band of
adventurers may encounter are the monsters and creatures that inhabit
the game world. This chapter details monsters ready for use in a Märchen
Engine game, from the humble hunting dog to the mightiest dragon.

## Reading monster entries

**Monster entries use the following format:**

*Size, Type, Terrain Locomotion, UPP, \#Appearing Treasure*

*Skills*

*Behavior*

*Attacks; Armor; Speed*

*Alignment; Morale*

- Various creatures have further powers and abilities given in
  bullet-points in their description

A creature’s UPP, just as for an ordinary human character, lists, as a
string of "pseudo-hexadecimal" digits, the monster's STR, DEX, END, INT,
INS, and PAC (for a beast) or the monster's STR, DEX, END, INT, EDU, and
SOC (for a more civilized creature)

***For example:***

***Dinosaur, Deinonychus***

*100kg Beast (Chaser), plains walker, 9G9198 \#App: 2D Treasure: None*

*Atheltics-2, Melee Combat-2, Survival-0, Recon-0, Tactics-1*

*Attacks if outnumbering the characters; flees on 5-*

*Claws (2D), teeth (2D); armor 1; speed 30m/action*

*Neutral; Morale DM+1*

*This means that a deinonychus weighs 100kg on average, lives in open
plains, walks (well, runs), has STR 9, DEX 16, END 9, INT 1, INS 9 and
PAC 8; 2D Deinonychuses will appear in an encounter; and it carries no
treasure.*

*It has Atheltics-2, Melee Combat-2, Survival-0, Recon-0, and Tactics-1
skills.*

*The deinonychuses will attack if they outnumber the characters, but
otherwise will flee on a throw of 5- on 2D.*

*It has claws causing 2D damage, teeth causing 2D damage, 1 point of
armor, and a speed of 30m per action (triple the human speed).*

*Its alignment is Neutral and its Morale DM is +1.*

## Monster Entries

While a large and varied number of monsters are listed here, Referees
are strongly encouraged to alter these monsters, or create entirely new
ones to fit their setting.

***Allip***

*0kg Undead, urban flyer, CAG0A0 \#App: 1 Treasure: Small*

*Athletics-1, Melee-0, Recon-1, Tactics-1*

*Attacks all living beings*

*Special attack; armor 0; flying speed 10m/action*

*Chaotic; Morale DM+2*

An Allip is an undead creatures that is the result of when a living
creature is driven to madness and suicide by enemies or circumstances.
Now, the remnant soul - the allip - haunts its former environs, seeking
revenge on all living creatures.

- Undead: immune to poison, disease, and suffocation.

- Incorporeal: immune to non-silver, non-magical weapons.

- Immune to mind-affecting magic.

- On a successful attack, an allip drains 1 INT point from its victim; a
  victim reduced to 0 INT becomes permanently insane (only curable by
  the **Restoration** spell). INT points otherwise regenerate at a rate
  of 1 point per day.

- Voice – anyone who hears the allip's babble must throw INT 10+ or be
  hypnotized and paralyzed for 1D rounds.

- Night vision.

***Ankheg***

*400kg Beast (Pouncer), forest walker, KAG0A3 \#App: 1D Treasure: Small*

*Neutral; Morale DM-1*

The ankheg is a burrowing insectoid predator, hiding underground and
waiting for prey to pass over its burrow. It then leaps out of the
ground, grabs its prey, and drags it back to its lair to feed.

***Demons***

Demons are powerful creatures of utter Chaos, possessing a malign
intelligence and bent on bringing destruction and suffering to mortals.
Demons come in a wide variety of shapes and with varying special
abilities; when summoning a demon, first choose the demon type.
Afterwards generate its abilities, as dictated by its type (see below),
from the following random table:

**Demon Special Abilities**

| **D66** | **Demon Special Ability**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 11      | The demon's attack is acidic and can destroy non-magical armor or clothing with a successful hit. A non-magical weapon striking the demon dissolves immediately after dealing damage. Magical arms and armor throw 6+ when coming into contact with the acid; if they fail, they dissolve as well.                                     |
| 12      | The demon is surrounded by a horrid aura with the radius of 3m, dealing 1D damage per round to surrounding creatures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 13      | The demon can go berserk! This provides DM+1 to hit; the demon is immune to fear; and it enjoys DM+2 to Morale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 14      | The demon possesses a breath weapon, usable 3 times a day, causing 3D fire damage to all within a 10m long, 5m wide cone emanating from its mouth or other frontal orifice. Victims may throw DEX 8+ to only suffer half damage (rounded down).                                                                                        |
| 15      | The demon may charge its target; this grants DM+2 to hit and +1D to damage. However, during the round in which the demon charges, attacks against the demon gain a DM+2 bonus to hit.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 16      | The demon may mentally enslave victims 3 times a day. The target must throw INT 8+ or be enthralled by the demon for 1D hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 21      | The demon can heal itself by dealing damage with its bite attack; for every 2 points of damage (rounded up) caused by the demon, it heals 1 point of its own injuries.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 22      | If flying at a 10m or higher height above ground, the demon may perform dive attacks, causing +2D damage. The demon may grab creatures smaller than itself and fly away with them, unless they succeed in a DEX 8+ or STR 8+ throw.                                                                                                    |
| 23      | Victims hit by the demon's claws are grabbed, and thus helpless until they succeed in an opposed STR throw (one throw allowed per round).                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 24      | Throw 1D: 1-2 – the demon is immune to fire; 3-4 – the demon is immune to cold; 5 – the demon is immune to electricity; 6 – the demon is immune to mind-affecting magic.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 25      | The demon is incorporeal, and thus weightless, formless, and unable to interact with physical objects except for by its attack and special abilities. It may pass through walls. If not originally immune to silver weapons, it also gains such immunity.                                                                              |
| 26      | The demon can transform its victims into others of its own wretched kind. Creatures slain by the demon will rise as demons of its kind unless their corpse is **blessed** (as per the spell).                                                                                                                                          |
| 31      | The demon always acts first in a combat round, regardless of any initiative throw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 32      | The demon is naturally invisible. It may act as it wishes, including attacking, without becoming visible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 33      | The demon gains DM+2 to resist hostile magic. This bonus is cumulative with any inherent magic resistance bonus the demon already possesses.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 34      | Victims of the demon's bite attack must throw END 8+ or be paralyzed for 1D rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 35      | The demon is venomous. Its bite delivers a potent poison: virulence 10+, damage 2D.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 36      | The demon regenerates 2D damage per round, and may reattach severed limbs, unless damaged by fire or acid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 41      | The demon is difficult to notice, gaining DM+2 to surprise rolls and has the Stealth-3 skill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 42      | The demon may swallow its victim whole if it hits its victim with an Effect of +4 or better. A swallowed victim takes damage equal to that of the demon's bite per round, until the demon is killed or the victim dies.                                                                                                                |
| 43      | Double the demon's movement speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 44      | Any being that sees the demon must throw INT 8+ or be paralyzed with dread. This effect ends when the demon leaves the victim's line of sight, or one round after the demon engages in combat.                                                                                                                                         |
| 45      | Increase the demon's armor by 5 points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 46      | The demon may use a trample attack in lieu of both its natural attacks, causing damage equal to both attacks at once, at DM+2 to hit human-sized targets.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 51      | The demon may teleport at will once per round. This does not use an action. The range is 10m in any direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 52      | The demon emits a nauseating aura; any creature coming within a 10m radius from the demon must throw END 8+ or be nauseated (DM-2 to all actions and only have one Action per round).                                                                                                                                                  |

- A creature slain by a wraith will rise as a wraith on the next
  midnight, unless its body is **blessed** or cremated.

***Yellow Mold***

*100kg Beast (Reducer), subterranean crawler, C0C080 \#App: 1 Treasure:
None*

*Melee Combat-0, Survival-0*

*Attacks if touched*

*Acid (1D); automatically hit if attacked; sedentary*

*Neutral; Morale DM: automatic success*

Yellow mold, a sessile monstrous fungus, typically covers an approximate
area of 3m by 3m. It does not move or attack, but it causes 1D acid
damage if touched.

- While all attacks automatically hit a yellow mold, it is immune to all
  damage except for fire damage. A torch causes it 1D damage, while
  fire-based magic or burning oil will cause their normal damage to a
  yellow mold.

- Every time a creature or object touches the yellow mold, throw 1D; on
  4-6, it emits a cloud of poisonous spores, filling a 3m-cubed area.
  Any creature caught within this cloud suffers the effect of a 8+/3D
  poison.

- Immune to mind-affecting spells.

***Zombie***

*50kg Undead, urban walker, 777055 \#App: 1D Treasure: None*

*Athletics-0, Melee Combat-0, Recon-0, Tactics-1, Survival-0*

*Attacks as commanded by the necromancer; zombies raised by other means
attack all living creatures on sight.*

*Claws (2D), armor 0; walk 5m/action*

*Chaotic; Morale DM: automatic success*

A reanimated corpse, reeking with rot and shambling along. Contrary to
popular belief, zombies do not crave brains; it is ghouls that crave
that delicacy.

- Undead: immune to poison, disease, and suffocation.

- Immune to mind-affecting magic.

# CHAPTER 13: PLANETARY WILDERNESS ENCOUNTERS

Characters in the uncivilized areas on the planet’s surface quickly find
out that they are not alone. So long as a world can support life, animal
encounters and other natural events are common, regardless of the
current terrain. This chapter discusses various encounters that can
occur in the wilderness on a planet’s surface.

## Animal Encounters

Animals in any ecological system interact with each other, forming food
chains, obeying instincts, defending territory, and generally living out
their lives. When people enter such an ecological system, they will
encounter the animals of the system, prompting natural reactions, such
as attack or flight.

Although the precise nature of animals may change, and they may prove
quite alien to ordinary experience, most will conform to the broad
classifications given below. A Referee may choose to establish his own
ecological system on a specific world, ignoring the encounter system
outlined here. This system, however, is intended to allow broad latitude
in both animal types and attack/defense mechanisms, while remaining
essentially logical and reasonable.

**Animal Types**: Nearly all animals may be classified into four basic
categories: herbivore, omnivore, carnivore, and scavenger. Specific
definitions for these terms are provided in a later section of these
rules, and differ from the precise scientific definitions in current
use. Within each category, a variety of animal types exist, based on
specific feeding/hunting habits; examples of this concept are grazers,
chasers, and pouncers.

Animals which are encountered may be further classified into various
categories and types, and specific attack and defense mechanisms
determined. The resulting description indicates the actions an animal
will take without resorting to such confining labels as bear or tiger.
While a Referee may well elect to use such names, this system also
allows the players freedom to encounter truly alien beasts as well.

### Animals and Characteristics

Animals have a similar range of characteristics to humans, but there are
several differences:

**Instinct**: Instinct is the animal equivalent of Education. Animals
apply their Instinct DM to tasks such as sensing prey or solving
problems.

**Pack**: Pack is the animal equivalent of Social Standing. The higher a
creature’s Pack score, the larger the group that it is associated with,
and the more standing the creature has in that group.

### Planetary Themes

A world's ecology can be extremely diverse. However, the Referee may
elect to implement specific themes on a planetary basis, to create
consistency and flavor in presentation. Distinctive features help make
each world stand out to the players as unique experiences. These could
range from basic symmetry to reproductive methods (and the associated
genders), from the number of limb pairs to the common sensory organs.
The implementation of a planetary theme lies at the discretion of the
Referee.

### Step One: Choose a Terrain

Terrain has an impact on the type of animals one might encounter. Giant
aquatic creatures are not found in forests, after all, nor are feathered
flying creatures found flying at the bottom of the ocean. The first step
in the rules for creating animals in the Märchen Engine is to choose the
creature’s terrain, as terrain can have a significant impact on an
animal’s statistics.

The Terrain DM Chart details modifiers for animal subtypes and sizes, In
addition, the result of 1D6 determines the basic movement for a given
creature (A for Amphibious, F for Flight, S for Swimming, and W for
Walking). Some movement codes have a number after them; these are an
additional Size DM for the animal.

#### Table: Terrain DM Chart

| Terrain              | Subtype DM | Size DM | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    |

| Deep ocean           | +4         | +2      | S +8 | S +6 | S +4 | S +2 | S    | S –2 |

### Step Two: Determine the Animal’s Type and Subtype

The Referee should then determine the animal’s type and subtype. If the
Referee is building up an encounter table, the animal’s type is obvious:
the type necessary to fill in this entry on the encounter table.
Otherwise, the Referee must choose an appropriate type: Carnivore,
Herbivore, Omnivore or Scavenger. The Referee might also roll on the 1D6
Animal Encounter Table Template to randomly choose an animal type.

Once the animal type has been determined, the Referee rolls 2D6, and add
in the terrain’s Subtype DM. After that, the Referee consults the
Subtype by Animal Type table under the column of the animal’s type to
determine the animal’s subtype.

#### Table: Subtype by Animal Type

| 2D6        | Herbivore    | Omnivore | Carnivore | Scavenger     |
|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 or less  | Filter       | Gatherer | Pouncer   | Carrion-Eater |
| 2          | Filter       | Eater    | Siren     | Reducer       |
| 3          | Intermittent | Gatherer | Pouncer   | Hijacker      |
| 4          | Intermittent | Eater    | Killer    | Carrion-Eater |
| 5          | Intermittent | Gatherer | Trapper   | Intimidator   |
| 6          | Intermittent | Hunter   | Pouncer   | Reducer       |
| 7          | Grazer       | Hunter   | Chaser    | Carrion-Eater |
| 8          | Grazer       | Hunter   | Chaser    | Reducer       |
| 9          | Grazer       | Gatherer | Chaser    | Hijacker      |
| 10         | Grazer       | Eater    | Killer    | Intimidator   |
| 11         | Grazer       | Hunter   | Chaser    | Reducer       |
| 12         | Grazer       | Gatherer | Siren     | Hijacker      |
| 13 or more | Grazer       | Gatherer | Chaser    | Intimidator   |

### Step Three: Note Modifiers and Skills by Subtype

Terran creatures that exemplify these specific subtypes are noted in
brackets after the name. The Referee should make note of the
characteristic modifiers and skills that are noted after the description
– the exact level of skills varies depending on the particular creature.

**Carrion-Eater** (vulture): Scavengers which wait for all other threats
to disperse before beginning. Carrion-eaters have Recon. Instinct +2.

**Chaser** (wolf): Animals which kill their prey by attacking and
exhausting it after a chase. Chasers have Athletics. Dexterity +4,
Instinct +2, Pack +2.

**Eater** (army ant): Eaters will eat anything they encounter, including
characters. Endurance +4. Pack +2.

**Filter** (earthworm): Herbivores which pass their environment through
their bodies are termed filters. Unlike grazers, which move to food,
filters move a flow of matter through themselves and filter out the
food. Endurance +4.

**Gatherer** (raccoon, chimpanzee): Gatherers are herbivores that
collect and store food. Gatherers have Recon. Pack +2.

**Grazer** (antelope): Grazers move from food source to food source,
often in large packs. Their primary form of defense tends to be fleeing
danger. Instinct +2, Pack +4.

**Hijacker** (lion): Scavengers which steal the kills of others through
brute force or weight of numbers are hijackers. Strength +2, Pack +2.

**Hunter** (baboon): Opportunistic predators that stalk easy prey.
Hunters have Survival. Instinct +2.

**Intermittent** (elephant): Herbivores that do not devote their entire
time to searching for food. Intermittents have Pack +4.

**Intimidator** (coyote): Scavengers which establish their claim to food
by frightening or intimidating other creatures.

**Killer** (shark): Carnivores that possess a raw killing instinct,
attacking in a frenzied manner. Killers have Natural Weapons and either
Strength or Dexterity +4, Instinct +4, Pack –2.

**Pouncer** (cat): Pouncers kill by stalking and ambushing their prey.
Pouncers have Recon and Athletics. Dexterity +4, Instinct +4.

**Reducer** (vermin): Reducers are scavengers that act constantly on all
available food, devouring even the remains left by other scavengers.
Pack +4

**Siren** (venus fly-trap): Sirens create a lure to attract prey.
Usually, this lure will be specific to the species the siren preys on,
but some rare lures are universal. Pack –4.

**Trapper** (spider): An animal which allows its prey to enter a trap.
Generally, any creature surprised by a trapper is caught in its trap.
Pack –2.

### Step Four: Determine Animal Size and Characteristics

For each creature, roll 2D6 for its Size and apply any Size DMs based on
terrain and movement. The creature’s Size determines its Weight,
Strength, Dexterity and Endurance – for example, a roll of 7 means that
the creature has a mass of 100kg, a Strength score of 3D6, a Dexterity
score of 3D6 and an Endurance of 3D6.

Intelligence for most animals is 0 or 1. Roll 2D6+DMs for the animal’s
Instinct and Pack. To determine the number appearing value, consult the
Number Appearing by Pack Characteristic Score table.

All animals have at least Athletics 0, Recon 0, and Survival 0, and most
will have 1D6 ranks split among these skills, Natural Weapons, and any
skills listed in their behavior.

#### Table: Animal Size

| 2D6       | Weight (kg) | Strength | Dexterity | Endurance |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 or less | 1           | 1        | 1D6       | 1         |
| 2         | 3           | 2        | 1D6       | 2         |
| 3         | 6           | 1D6      | 2D6       | 1D6       |
| 4         | 12          | 1D6      | 2D6       | 1D6       |
| 5         | 25          | 2D6      | 3D6       | 2D6       |
| 6         | 50          | 2D6      | 4D6       | 2D6       |
| 7         | 100         | 3D6      | 3D6       | 3D6       |
| 8         | 200         | 3D6      | 3D6       | 3D6       |
| 9         | 400         | 4D6      | 2D6       | 4D6       |
| 10        | 800         | 4D6      | 2D6       | 4D6       |
| 11        | 1,600       | 5D6      | 2D6       | 5D6       |
| 12        | 3,200       | 5D6      | 1D6       | 5D6       |
| 13        | 5,000       | 6D6      | 1D6       | 6D6       |
| 14        | 10,000      | 6D6      | 1D6       | 6D6       |
| 15        | 15,000      | 7D6      | 1D6       | 7D6       |
| 16        | 20,000      | 7D6      | 1D6       | 7D6       |
| 17        | 25,000      | 8D6      | 1D6       | 8D6       |
| 18        | 30,000      | 8D6      | 1D6       | 8D6       |
| 19        | 35,000      | 9D6      | 1D6       | 9D6       |
| 20+       | 40,000      | 9D6      | 1D6       | 9D6       |

#### Table: Number Appearing by Pack Characteristic Score

| Pack  | Number Appearing |
|-------|------------------|
| 0     | 1                |
| 1–2   | 1D3              |
| 3–5   | 1D6              |
| 6–8   | 2D6              |
| 9–11  | 3D6              |
| 12–14 | 4D6              |
| 15+   | 5D6              |

### Step Five: Determine Animal’s Weapons, Armor and Base Speed

Roll 2D6 separately for the animal’s Weapons and Armor.

**Weapons**: When generating weapons, roll 2D6 and consult the Animal
Weapons table. Add a +8 DM if the animal is a Carnivore, and a +4 if it
is an Omnivore; subtract a –6 DM if the animal is a Herbivore.
Scavengers automatically have Teeth in addition to any other weapons. If
a number is present after the Weapons type, then add that number to the
number of damage dice the creature rolls. Damage from attacks depends on
the creature’s Strength score, as shown in the Damage by Strength table.

**Armor**: When generating an animal’s armor, roll 2D6-7, and add the
animal’s Size result (the die roll result that determined the animal’s
size, not the actual weight of the animal.) Add a +4 DM when rolling for
armor if the animal is a Herbivore, and a +2 if it is an Scavenger;
apply a –2 DM if the animal is a Carnivore. Also, Flyers suffer a –2 DM
when determining armor. Consult the Animal Armor table for the animal’s
armor rating.

**Base Speed**: An animal’s base speed is determined by generating a
Speed Multiplier, as per the Animal Speed Multiplier by Subtype table,
and multiplying that by 6, which is the average speed of a human in
meters per minor action. If an Animal Speed Multiplier value falls below
the value found in the Minimum Speed column, round it up to the Minimum
Speed value.

## Animals in Combat

Unless otherwise noted, animals operate just like characters in combat.
The range category of an animal’s weapons can be found in the Animal
Weapon Ranges table.

## Creating Encounter Tables

The system for creating animals in the Märchen Engine rules can be used
to generate creatures on the fly. However, the system works best when
the Referee prepares an encounter table for each terrain likely to be
encountered. This not only gives the Referee statistics for wilderness
adventuring, but also provided a large amount of potential background
data for expanding the world within the universe the Referee has
created.

To create an encounter table, first the Referee should select a table
format. Although an encounter table can be in whatever format the
Referee desires, the two formats most commonly used are represented in
these rules as the 1D6 Animal Encounter Table Template and the 2D6
Animal Encounter Table Template. Note that the Templates only provide an
animal's type (carnivore, herbivore, omnivore or scavenger), and in the
case of the 2D6 table, event.

Each entry should be generated in turn. When an encounter table
indicates that an event will occur, the Referee should create an event
appropriate to the world and terrain. An event may be almost anything,
including a natural disaster or seismic event, an interesting terrain
feature or curiosity, unusual flora or weather. The Hills Terrain
Encounter Table is an example of a completed encounter table.

## Using the Encounter Tables

Each day an adventuring band may possibly have one or more encounters
with some animal life forms. As a general rule, the Referee will check
for an encounter once while the band is travelling and once while the
band is halted (for rest, exercise, encampment, or whatever). There is a
one-third chance (5+ on 1D6) that an animal encounter will occur in any
of the specified terrain types. The Referee may choose to modify this
frequency depending on planetary or local conditions.

In addition, specific encounters at specific locations are always
possible. For example, the Referee may already have populated a location
(perhaps a ruin) with specific animals. These are not subject to normal
random encounter rules.

By their lifeless nature, vacuum worlds (and any other world without
life) tend to have encounter tables comprised primarily of events. On an
airless world, events could include silt pools that operate like
quicksand, magnetic anomalies, solar flares, or possibly tracks left by
previous explorers.

## Animal Reactions in Encounters

When characters disturb an animal or otherwise draw attention to
themselves while within its territory roll 2D6 and consult the Animal
Reactions by Subtype table. If the result on the table is neither attack
nor flee, then the animal stands still until provoked again, in which
case roll again.

# CHAPTER 14: SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS

In the Märchen Engine, an encounter is defined as an unexpected or
casual meeting with someone or something. A large part of the Referee’s
job is the administration of encounters. Through encounters, the Referee
presents information, opportunities and conflicts for the players to
interact with, which is the core of any gaming session.

There are a number of different types of social encounters: routine,
legal, patron, random, rumor and scenario. The Encounter Types Overview
table offers suggestions on the frequency of various encounters, and the
chance associated with the occurrence of such an encounter.

**Encounter Tables**: This chapter provides a number of encounter tables
to serve as inspiration for the Referee. The Referee is encouraged to
create tables more in line with their Märchen Engine universe or with
the specific adventure they are running.

#### Table: Encounter Types Overview

| Encounter Type | Frequency | Chance                   |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Routine        | As needed | As needed                |
| Scenario       | As needed | As needed                |
| Legal          | Daily     | Law Level or less on 2D6 |
| Random         | Daily     | 8+ on 2D6                |
| Patron         | Weekly    | 9+ on 2D6                |
| Rumor          | Weekly    | 7+ on 2D6                |

## Routine Encounters

Routine encounters involve meeting normal people while doing normal
activities, such as interviewing potential crew members in a starport
diner or buying new ammunition from the clerk in a gun shop. Such scenes
are rarely important in and of themselves. From a roleplaying
perspective, routine encounters create a background of expected behavior
that makes scenario encounters and random encounters stand out in
comparison because of their unexpected content. Routine encounters help
move characters logically from the time and place of one important scene
to the next.

## Scenario Encounters

Within the Märchen Engine rules, an adventure is defined as a story for
players to experience, comprised of a series of related scenes or
encounters. These related encounters are called scenario encounters,
because they serve to further the plot of the adventure toward its
climax. The Referee creates scenario encounters as dictated by the story
they will tell.

## Random Encounters

Random encounters offer players a sense of variety in their gaming
experience. These colorful encounters often include individuals pursuing
goals that are unrelated to those of the adventurers themselves. From a
roleplaying perspective, random encounters help create the illusion of a
universe that exists outside of the adventurers' experiences, thus
creating a sense of verisimilitude.

Random encounters can be determined by rolling a D66 on a table such as
the Random Encounters table presented in these rules. Unique tables
might be created for specific worlds or adventures. As with other social
encounters, non-player character reactions may be determined randomly by
the Referee or selected according to the nature of the situation.

#### Table: Random Encounters

| 65  | Workers                         |
| 66  | Referee’s Choice                |

## Legal Encounters

Legal encounters involve interactions with local planetary law
enforcement. Some worlds have stricter laws than others. This is
represented by the world's Law Level value. The higher the Law Level,
the more likely that offworld visitors will be harassed by local law
enforcement. When the Referee determines that a legal encounter happens,
a local police officer will stop the adventurers and require
identification. Further complications are at the Referee's discretion.

## Patron Encounters

A patron is a non-player character that gives financial or other support
to a person, organization, cause, or activity. Referees often use
patrons as a tool to attempt to engage player characters in adventures.
Patron encounters represent the beginning of an open-ended adventure
idea, aka the hook. The patron provides the mission that serves as the
basis for an adventure, as well as the reward for successfully
completing it.

Adventurers frequently seek out patrons as a source of employment. Less
frequently, a patron may seek out the adventurers, based on their
reputation. The Referee may roll a D66 on the Patron Encounters table or

### Format for Patron Encounters

Some Referees prefer to “wing it,” and consider little more than a
patron’s name and the mission at hand. However, for those seeking a more
detailed way of creating reusable patron encounters, the Märchen Engine
rules offers a fairly comprehensive format for recording patron
encounters. This format identifies five specific elements for a given
patron. These are:

- The patron’s name and role. Names can be changed if the patron
  encounter is reused.

- The skills and resources required to complete the mission

- The suggested reward for the mission

- The mission as described to the characters

- What’s really going on. Several possible variants are presented –
  either pick or roll for which is the real situation. This is the key
  element that allows reusability.

Here is an example of a patron encounter captured in this format:

### Bruce Ayala, Interplanetary Playboy

**Required**: Investigate, Streetwise; No special equipment required.

**Reward**: ₢500 a day, plus expenses; minimum of two weeks.

#### Players’ Information

Word on the street is that the famous holovid star and interplanetary
playboy Bruce Ayala is cruising the local bar scene. That night, Bruce
Ayala, along with his entourage of publicists and models, staggers into
the same locale as the party and buys a round for every offworlder. Over
the course of the evening, he continually hounds the party for details
of their exploits, always comparing their adventures to roles he's
portrayed. Late into the evening, Ayala corners one of the party members
and offers the crew a job, if it can be handled with discretion. He
provides contact information, and arranges a meeting to discuss terms,
if they are interested.

#### Referee’s Information

When Bruce Ayala achieved system-wide fame as a holovid star, he admits
that it went right to his head, and it cost him the love of a wonderful
young woman by the name of Martha McKernan. He's kept tabs on Martha
over the years through private investigators and the like, one of whom
has reported that she's gone missing a few days ago. Ayala wants to hire
the party to discretely investigate Martha's disappearance, locate the
young woman and rescue her from whatever situation she might be in. He's
concerned that his current media distributor, Penultimate Productions,
have pulled something, as he has been secretly planning to sign a new
contract with a competitor, System Media Studios. That represents a
great loss for Penultimate Productions, and Ayala feels that they are
not above coercion to insure the holovid star continues to bring them
money. In all of the options presented below, further development is
left to the discretion of the Referee.

1.  All is as it appears. Bruce Ayala is correct; Penultimate
    Productions has discovered their star's clandestine plans. Slowly
    moving away from the verge of bankruptcy, the media distributor owes
    their recovery to Bruce Ayala's success in the box office. Worried
    that the star's departure could cost them everything, the executive
    producers have hired thugs to kidnap Martha McKernan and use her to
    force him to extend his current contract.

2.  Sadly, Bruce Ayala is incorrect. His own agent, Cornelius Brass, has
    a gambling problem, a huge gambling problem. He's fallen in so much
    debt to the local crime syndicate that they've started threatening
    his life and the lives of his family, and the man has become
    desperate. Brass has arranged for the kidnapping of Martha McKernan,
    hoping to ransom her to enough Crowns to pay off his debt and tuck
    away a tidy bankroll so he can continue his gambling habit.

3.  Bruce Ayala has been less than truthful. He's been stalking the
    innocent Martha McKernan for years, using his fame and fortune to
    attempt to force her into marrying him. In an act of desperation,
    Martha has gone on the run, trying to make her way out of the star
    system undetected in an effort to find safety from Ayala's
    overwhelming attentions.

4.  System Media Studios has kidnapped Martha McKernan as a form of
    leverage to use on Bruce Ayala in the event he changes his mind and
    backs out of the secret negotiations. They believe he is unaware of
    her disappearance, and only intend to reveal her status as a
    prisoner should he start entertaining the thought of extending his
    current contract with Penultimate Productions.

5.  Martha McKernan has watched Bruce Ayala's meteoric rise to success
    with envy and jealousy. She feels scorned by the holovid star, and
    every image of Bruce Ayala with some starlet has pushed her further
    into the depths of hatred and loathing. Martha has arranged her own
    "kidnapping", so that she can demand a costly ransom from Bruce. Any
    extended contact with Martha will reveal that she is not completely
    sane, and will likely go to extreme lengths to harm and humiliate
    Bruce Ayala.

6.  Martha McKernan is actually on vacation, hiking deep in a wilderness
    preserve to get away from civilization for a few weeks. Edmund Sang,
    a private investigator employed by Bruce Ayala, has reported her
    missing simply to get more money from Mr. Ayala to "locate" her.
    When the party shows up and begins investigating, he realizes that
    he might get caught and so desperately attempts to redirect them, to
    avoid having his deception discovered. Sang's efforts to create a
    false trail points to the local crime syndicate, who do not take
    kindly to the party investigating their illicit activities looking
    for a girl they've never heard of.

## Rumors

Rumors are best thought of as encounters with information rather than
with people or events. Rumors often fill one of two different roles:
they plant the seed for a potential new adventure, or they provide
background information that makes the universe seem larger than just the
character's experiences. Rumors can take many forms, including, but not
limited to, graffiti on the walls, newspaper or online articles,
overheard conversations, secret notes, and televised broadcasts.

Because rumors are encounters with information, the player character has
no patron should they decide to pursue the rumor itself. If the matter
doesn't pan out, the player character has no one to blame but himself.
However, given the promise of potential reward, enterprising characters
are likely to attempt to exploit the information they've uncovered.

Random encounters are often determined by rolling a D66 on a table such
as the Random Rumor Content table presented in these rules. As with
other encounter types, unique tables might be created for specific
worlds or adventures.

#### Table: Random Rumor Content

## Influencing Attitudes

The Referee determines the starting attitude of any character the
characters encounter during the game. The characters can then try to
influence the character's attitude using Social Standing and various
interaction skills, such as Liaison and Carousing. The Attitude
Descriptions table describes the effects of character attitudes.

#### Table: Attitude Descriptions

| Attitude    | Means                         | Possible Actions                                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Hostile     | Will take risks to oppose you | Attack, interfere, berate, flee                    |
| Unfriendly  | Wishes you ill                | Mislead, gossip, avoid, watch suspiciously, insult |
| Indifferent | Doesn't care either way       | Socially acceptable interaction                    |
| Friendly    | Wishes you well               | Chat, advise, offer limited help, advocate         |
| Helpful     | Will take risks to aid you    | Protect, back up, heal, aid, support               |

Characters can attempt to improve another's attitude, using a Difficult
(-2) Social Standing-based check using the appropriate skill, usually
Liaison. With a success, the character's attitude is improved by one
step; with an exceptional success, the attitude improves by two steps.
Note that a particularly bad influence check can actually make a
character's attitude worse. On an exceptional failure, the character's
attitude shifts one step more Hostile. In general, a character can
attempt to influence another character only once in any given scene.

Players get to choose their characters’ attitudes, and so interaction
skills cannot force a player-character to behave in a specific way.
Typically, the only way a player character can be forced into a
particular behavior is through the use of psionics or some other
external force.

# CHAPTER 15: STARSHIP ENCOUNTERS

Space is amazingly vast, and starships are incredibly small in
comparison. Aside from points where people tend to congregate, such as
within 100 diameters of inhabited planets or potential refueling
locations, the chances of encountering another vessel is small enough to
essentially occur only at the Referee's discretion. Random encounters
with intelligent beings in such areas are extremely unlikely, and
player-characters would be correct in assuming that such an encounter
was not a random occurrence. Referees are encouraged to simply use the
Astrogation Encounter Type table for random encounters under such
conditions, simply to avoid violating the players' suspension of
disbelief by providing generally non-starship encounters.

However, within those regions of interplanetary space where people
congregate, there's always a chance for a space encounter. As a general
rule of thumb, the Referee should check for space encounters when
entering or leaving such a region. Roll 1D6; on a 6, a space encounter
occurs. Referees may determine the type of space encounter based on the
events occurring within the game, or they may randomly determine the
type of encounter by rolling 2D6 and consulting the Space Encounters
table. Each entry on the Space Encounters table is supported by a
sub-table; the Referee can roll 1D6 and consult the sub-table for a more
specific example of a random encounter if needed.

Like any random encounter system, if a result doesn't make sense for the
current location in the game, then feel free to ignore it and roll
again, or better yet, choose a result that does make sense.

## Encounter Range

If two vessels randomly encounter each other while travelling in the
depths of interplanetary space, the encounter will begin at Very Long
range. More often, ships engage near a planet at Medium range. If the
characters do not succeed in a Comms check (as modified by any stealth
efforts made by the other vessel), then the encounter begins at one
range category closer (Long instead of Very Long, or Short instead of
Medium).

Most civilian vessels, as well as military vessels that are not
currently engaged in maneuvers, have transponders that operate as an
"Identification Friend or Foe" (IFF) system to differentiate friendly
from enemy spacecraft on sensors. When these are active, other vessels
gain a DM+4 on detection efforts. (It is generally against interstellar
law to operate a civilian vessel without such a transponder, but some
ship crews have been known to disconnect their transponders when
engaging in illicit activities.)

Some encounters, such as the starship encounter types, ignore the
general rules for range, and instead occur at a range determined by the
Referee.

## Space Encounter Descriptions

Most of the entries on the space encounter tables are self-explanatory.
However, some encounters have special rules that require further
explanation.

**Comet**: Dust and particles from the comet interfere with some
sensors, imposing a DM-2 on Comms skill checks while in the comet's
tail. An unusual object or vessel may be found at the heart of a comet,
but such occurrences are very rare and reaching such sites imposes a
risk of impact with space debris.

**Debris from collision or attack**, **Lost equipment or garbage**, and
**Micrometeorite storm**: The vessel is in danger of being impacted by
small objects with great force. The vessel suffers 1D6 damage for every
point of the vessel’s Thrust rating, unless the pilot succeeds in a
Pilot skill check to avoid the debris.

**Interplanetary dust cloud**: Dust clouds interfere with some sensors,
imposing a -2 on Comms skill checks while in the cloud. The Referee may
impose a second space encounter within the cloud, or simply impose a
risk of impact with space debris.

**Jettisoned cargo pod**: For some reason, another vessel has jettisoned
its cargo into space, generally to protect the safety of its crew from
physical threats or legal actions. The contents of the pod can be
determined randomly as per the trade goods rules in **Chapter 7: Trade
and Commerce**, and often come with complications related to who dropped
it and why.

**Solar flares**: Solar flares release tremendous amounts of
electromagnetic energy (including harmful ultraviolet rays and X-rays),
as well as highly charged protons and electrons. Being caught in a solar
flare receives 1D6x100 rads every hour until the flares pass. See
**Chapter 11: Environments and Hazards** for details on handling
Radiation Exposure.

# CHAPTER 16: MAGICAL TREASURE

Piles of golden coins and precious gems glimmer under torchlight.
Wondrous weapons stick at odd angles out of a dragon's hoard gold.
Potions gleam in an alchemist's laboratory. In Swords and Sorcery tales,
adventurers pursue treasure. Treasure may come in many forms: coins,
gemstones, jewelry, or magnificent magical items. This chapter presents
simple rules for generating treasures belonging to monsters, found
underground, or in ruins. It also presents rules detailing how skilled
characters may brew positions, scribe scrolls, and create magical items.

## Magical Research

The most coveted of treasures are magical items – from potions and
glowing swords to even more wondrous and mysterious objects. This
sub-chapter contains rules for identifying existing magical items, as
well as producing them. It also shows how sorcerers may research new,
original, spells to add to their vast arcane knowledge.

### Researching New Spells

A sorcerer may research new spells. This takes two weeks of intensive
research and costs 1000₢ per Circle. After spending the time and gold,
throw Sorcery 4+ with a -DM equal to the spells Circle (e.g. a
1<sup>st</sup> Circle spell will be at DM-1 while a 6<sup>th</sup>
Circle spell will be at DM-6). If successful, the sorcerer gains the new
spell. If failed, the time and gold are wasted but the sorcerer may try
again to research the spell. A throw of "Snake Eyes" (a result of 2
before modifiers are added) is a Critical Failure and may entail a
mishap. A throw with an Effect of -4 and worse is also a Critical
Failure may entail a mishap. In such cases of Critical Failure, the
sorcerer must make a Sorcery 5+ throw with the same -DM; if failed
again, they suffer a Mishap as per the Sorcery chapter.

A sorcerer requires a **library** of at least 4000₢ in value to research
new spells. This cost increases by 2000₢ per Circle beyond the
1<sup>st</sup> for the new spell being researched. Furthermore, for
every 10000₢ invested in the library beyond the spell’s Circle base
requirement, the sorcerer gains DM+1 to the spell research throw, up to
DM+3.

The Referee is the final and absolute arbiter of what spells would be
permissible in their campaign and which Circle and Shade a proposed new
spell would be at. The Referee should note that in such a sword &
sorcery setting as entailed by these rules, direct damage "blast" spells
should be rare, teleportation (or worse – time travel!) should be
avoided like the plague, and scrying spells should be significantly
limited in power. Flying wizards who teleport and throw fireballs around
are elements quite far from the spirit of the **Märchen Engine** rules.
Though this, of course, is at the Referee's discretion.

### Identifying Magical Items

Identifying magical items depends on the item's rarity.

Identifying common magical items requires a day of undisturbed careful
investigation and an Artifice 6+ or Sorcery 9+ throw.

Identifying common potions requires a day of undisturbed careful
investigation and an Alchemy 6+ or Sorcery 9+ throw.

The Referee is the final arbiter of what constitutes a common magical
item or potion, and which items and potions are rare. However, the
probabilities of finding each item or potion on the treasure tables (see
below) can serve as a useful guideline.

In those cases of rare magical items and potions, or when trying to
identify an item or potion after failing the above investigation throws,
the sorcerer must research the item. Researching an item, just like a
spell, takes 2 weeks and costs 1000₢. Throw Artifice 6+ or Alchemy 6+
(Sorcery will not suffice here) to identify the item or potion. There is
no risk of mishap in this case, but if the throw fails, the sorcerer
wastes the time and money invested in the research. Further attempts to
identify the item are allowed. The sorcerer may try again at the same
costs of time and money.

### Creating Magical Items and Brewing Potions

Artificers may create magical items. To create an item, the artificer
must know a spell with an effect like that of the item, research this
effect as if it were a spell, or find a formula for that item.
Artificers may also copy the design of any magical item they possess.

To create a magical item, make an Artifice 6+ throw. The Referee should
enact a DM penalty to this throw depending on the item's complexity or
its equivalent spell Circle. Magical item costs and creation times
depend on their type, as given in the table below, but should be
multiplied, at the Referee's discretion, by the item's equivalent spell
Circle or based on its complexity, to a maximum multiplier of x6.

Creating magical items is a dangerous process. A throw of "Snake Eyes"
(an unmodified result of two) is always a Critical Failure and may
entail a mishap. A throw with an Effect of -4 and worse is also
considered a Critical Failure may entail a mishap. In such cases of
Critical Failure, the sorcerer must make a Sorcery 5+ throw with the
same -DM; if failed again, they suffer a Mishap as per the Sorcery
chapter.

An artificer requires a **workshop** of at least 4000₢ in value to
create magical items, with this cost increased by 2000₢ per equivalent
spell Circle beyond the 1<sup>st</sup>. Furthermore, for every 10000₢ in
workshop worth beyond the equivalent spell’s Circle base requirement in
gold, the sorcerer gains DM+1 to the item creation throw, up to DM+3.

Brewing potions follows the same procedure as detailed above for magical
items but uses the Alchemy skill instead of Artifice and requires a
separate **laboratory** rather than a **workshop**.

We encourage the Referee to require rare components – those that require
an adventure to obtain – for creating powerful magical items and
position. This is especially true for permanent-effect magical items.

## Generating Treasures

The following tables for the random generation of treasures refer to the
five types of treasure noted in the monster descriptions in the previous
chapter. The Referee may use these tables to randomly generate treasure,
modify the results as they see fit, or hand-craft treasures. We
encourage the Referee to hand-craft important or famous treasures, while
randomly generating more common treasures, such as those found after
defeating monsters.

Monsters' treasures are usually found in their lairs. There are certain
exceptions, such as those monsters who swallow enemies whole and thus
may carry treasure in their bellies. Sentient monsters will use magical
items in their possession to their best effect, or bestow them as gifts
to their most trusted minions.

Treasures come in **five** types:

**Incidental:** treasure collected by happenstance by creatures
otherwise uninterested in treasure, such as the remnants of swallowed
adventurers in a monster's belly or remains of the dead near a giant
carnivorous plant.

**Small:** a small treasure, as sometimes hoarded by lesser sentient
monsters.

**Medium:** a moderately-sized treasure, as occasionally found in the
tombs of undead.

**Large:** a significant treasure, as found in the lairs of more
powerful monsters.

**Hoard:** a treasure worthy of a king or a dragon!

When generating a treasure, note that each column usually gives a throw
on 2D necessary for that part of a treasure to exist in the given loot.
Note that in rare cases, monsters who are normally supposed to possess
treasure may have none!

### Potions

Potions take effect on the same round they are imbibed, and their effect
– unless noted otherwise - lasts for 1D+6 turns.

Drinking multiple potions at once is dangerous! If a character drinks
one potion while another is active on them, they must throw END 4+ or
suffer a roll on the Mutation table (in the Sorcery chapter)!

| 11      | **Animal Control:** the imbiber may control 2D normal animals or 1D giant animals within 20m as per **charm monster**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12      | **Clairaudience:** the imbiber may hear up to 20m, including through walls, through the ears of any creatures in the area. If there are no creatures in the target area, this effect fails, and the potion is wasted.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 13      | **Clairvoyance:** the imbiber may see up to 20m, including through walls, through the eyes of creatures in the area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 15      | **Delusion:** the imbiber is absolutely convinced that they have drunk a potion of another kind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 16      | **Diminution:** shrinks the imbiber and everything they carry to 15cm tall. The character gains DM+4 to all Stealth throws but cannot damage larger creatures with any attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 21      | **Dragon Control:** the imbiber may control one dragon or drake within 20m as per **Charm Monster**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 26      | **Gaseous Form:** the imbiber takes the form of a translucent cloud of gas; all equipment carried by them falls on the floor. While in gaseous form, a creature may not attack but may move 5m per action through cracks and below doors. Gaseous creatures are immune to non-magical weapons.                                                                                                                             |

| 35      | **Heroism:** the imbiber gains a temporary Melee Combat-3 skill, or adds +1 to their Melee Combat skill, whichever is higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 36      | **Human Control:** the imbiber may control 2D human beings or similar humanoids as per the **Charm Person** spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 41      | **Invisibility:** the imbiber, along their equipment, becomes invisible as per the **Invisibility** spell. It is possible to consume this potion in 1/6 increments, in which the invisibility lasts for 1 turn per dose. Any combat ends this invisibility.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 42      | **Invulnerability:** the imbiber gains DM+2 to resist all magic, poisons, diseases, and similar effects, and gains 5 additional points of armor protection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 43      | **Levitation:** the imbiber may levitate up or down at 5m per action. The potion does not grant the ability to move horizontally, although it is possible to clamber sideways by holding onto walls and pushing.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 44      | **Longevity:** the imbiber becomes 10 years younger, to a minimum of 18 years. This reverses any Aging Table effects suffered in these years. However, every time one consumes this potion after the first one, they must throw 3+ to avoid a mishap, which reverses all previous longevity potion effects, returning the character to the age they would have been without the potion.                                    |
| 45      | **Oil of Sharpness:** when applied to a blade, the oil temporarily enhances its power to that of a lesser magical weapon, granting DM+1 to hit and allowing it to harm creatures only harmed by magical weapons.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 46      | **Oil of Slipperiness:** a character coated with this oil cannot be grappled; any grapple attempt against it will automatically fail. They will also automatically escape any ropes or manacles. Furthermore, if used to coat the floor, any creature attempting to transverse the oiled area must throw DEX 12+ or fall prone. The effect lasts for 8 hours, until **dispelled**, or until cleaned off by enough alcohol. |
| 51      | **Love:** the imbiber becomes charmed by the next sentient creature they lay eyes on. Furthermore, if the creature belongs to a similar species to that of the drinker and to their preferred sex, the imbiber will be deeply enamored with it. The charm effect only lasts 1D+6 turns. Only **dispel magic** will cause the imbiber to cease to be enamored by a creature it fell in love with due to this potion.        |
| 52      | **Plant Control:** the imbiber may control plants and plant-like creatures (including fungi) within a 10m by 10m area in a 20m range. Intelligent plants may throw INT 8+ to resist this effect or be **charmed** for 1D+6 turns. Non-sentient plants will bend to the imbiber's will. Even otherwise immobile plants will move at the drinker's whim!                                                                     |

| 54      | **Poison:** as above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 56      | **Speed:** the imbiber will move at double their regular speed and enjoy 3 actions per round rather than the usual 2. However, the imbiber will permanently age one year due to the strain on their body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 62      | **Sweet Water:** when poured into water, it will turn up to 10,000 cubic meters of contaminated water or other liquid into potable water; it may also turn 100 cubed meters of acid into potable water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This effect will work through any barrier or wall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 64      | **Undead Control:** the imbiber may control 2D undead as per the **charm monster** spell. Controlled undead will become hostile when the potion's duration ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 65      | **Water Breathing**: the imbiber of this potion may breathe underwater, in any depth, for 4 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 66      | **Mutation!** Throw on the Mutation table in the Sorcery chapter. This mutation, unlike many other potion effects, is permanent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Rings

A character may wear up to two active magical rings at one; further
rings worn at the same time will not function.

| **2D** | **Ring**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2      | **Spell Turning:** the ring may be used for 2D times. Each time the wearer uses it, it negates a single spell's effect on the wearer. Once all uses are spent, the ring turns to dust.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 3      | **Djinn Calling:** one a week, the wearer may summon a **djinn**, who will serve him for up to one day. If the **djinn** is slain, the ring turns to dust.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4      | **Regeneration:** the wearer regenerates one characteristic point of injury per round and will regrow severed or mangled body parts. However, the ring may not cure damage or injury caused by fire or acid.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5      | **Fire Resistance:** renders the wearer immune to all forms of ordinary flame and grants DM+2 to resist magical fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6      | **Delusion:** the wearer absolutely believes that the ring is of another magical type (rolled randomly).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 7      | **Protection:** any who attacks the wearer suffers DM-1 to hit and the wearer gains DM+1 to all throws to resist magic, disease, or poison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 8      | **Invisibility:** one per turn, the wearer may become **invisible**, per the spell of the same name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 9      | **Weakness:** once worn, the only way to remove this ring is by a **remove curse** spell. It reduces the wearer's STR to 2 as long as it is worn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 10     | **Water Walking:** the wearer may walk across water as if it was solid ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 11     | **Telekinesis:** the ring grants its wearer the ability to move up to 100kg with his mind at will.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 12     | **Wishes:** the ring stores 1D **wishes**. A **wish** is the most powerful magic available – capable of altering reality and even resurrecting the dead with no risks entailed. However, we encourage the Referee to strictly limit, and nearly always subvert, such wishes to avoid absurdities or cheating. Once the ring runs out of wishes, it crumbles to dust. |

### Scrolls

A spell scroll is a piece of parchment of papyrus with eldritch spells
inscribed on it. Any character with at least Sorcery-1 can read a scroll
and cast the spell imbued in it. Once cast, the scroll crumbles to dust.

Additional scrolls found in treasure include scrolls of ward, cursed
scrolls, and – of course – non-magical treasure maps.

| **2D** | **Scroll**                                  |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2      | 6<sup>th</sup> Circle spell                 |
| 3      | Cursed scrolls                              |
| 4      | 4<sup>th</sup> Circle spell                 |
| 5      | 2<sup>nd</sup> Circle spell                 |
| 6      | Treasure map (generate as a Large treasure) |
| 7      | 1<sup>st</sup> Circle spell                 |
| 8      | Ward against undead                         |
| 9      | Ward against elementals                     |
| 10     | 3<sup>rd</sup> Circle spell                 |
| 11     | Ward against magic                          |
| 12     | 5<sup>th</sup> Circle spell                 |

**Cursed scrolls**

The reader of a cursed scroll suffers a horrible curse upon reading it.
**Remove curse** will reverse such affliction, except for the loss of a
magic item, which is irreversible. Roll for the curse on the following
table.

| **1D** | **Curse**                                                  |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | One magic item in the victim's possession crumbles to dust |
| 2      | One characteristic falls to 2                              |
| 3      | The victim cannot gain new Experience                      |
| 4      | The victim "forgets" one skill                             |
| 5      | The victim is polymorphed into a tiny, slimy toad          |
| 6      | The victim is blinded                                      |

**Scrolls of Warding**

Any literate character, even without the Sorcery skill, may use a scroll
of warding. The scroll crumbles to dust after being read but grants a
3m-radius area of protection against the creatures it wards against for
1D turns, or until one of the creatures protected by the ward tries to
attack the creature warded against. A creature warded against cannot
enter the warded area or attack those within it.

The only exception is a scroll of **ward against magic**, which protects
not only from magical (usually summoned) creatures, but also prevents
any spell or spell-like ability from penetrating the warded area.

### Rods, Staves, and Wands

Traditional implements of sorcery, wands are small and thin; staves are
long; and rods are in between in size. Any character may use a rod. Only
characters with at least Sorcery-1 may use a staff or a wand, but they
do not to make any throw to use them (other than the throws needed to
identify the item).

Each of these items typically uses "charges", used to power activations.
When found, a rod or wand will have 2D charges and a staff 3D charges.
Each use expends one charge unless noted otherwise.

One cannot recharge rods, staves, and wands. Once all charges are
expended, the item becomes inert.

**Throw 1D; on 1-2, roll on the rods and staves table. On 3-6, roll on
the wands table.**

**Rods and Staves**

All magical staves may also act as weapons (as per the **staff**
described in the **Equipment** chapter).

| **2D** | **Rod or Staff**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2      | **Staff of Wizardry:** this staff has the powers of a staff of power and a **wand of paralysis**. In addition, it may serve to cast **invisibility**, **conjure elemental**, or summon a djinn as per the **ring of djinn summoning**. Finally, the user may break the staff in a **final blow**, dealing 1D damage per remaining charge to all creatures within 10m, including the user themselves, and destroying the staff. |
| 3      | **Rod of Resurrection:** allows raising dead characters of creatures per the Rebirth spell. Each use expends three charges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4      | **Staff of Commanding:** commands animals, humans, and plants as a respective **ring of command**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5      | **Staff of the Serpent:** this staff does not employ charges. It grants DM+1 to hit. Additionally, upon command, the staff can become a giant constrictor snake for 1D rounds, under the user's control. If the snake is slain, the staff crumbles to dust.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6-7    | **Staff of Striking:** grants DM+1 to hit. Upon expending a charge when striking an opponent, it causes 4D damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 8-9    | **Staff of Healing**: heals any creature touched by it as if they have rested for 5D days under a healer's oversight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

After 2D such attacks, the scarab crumbles to dust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 65      | **Stone of Commanding Earth Elementals:** upon command, the bowl summons one earth elemental per day, requiring a turn to summon the elemental. Once the elemental appears, the user must concentrate to control it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 66      | **Stone of Luck:** grants any person who carries it DM+1 to all attack throws and any throws made to resist magic, poison, or disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

# CHAPTER 16.5: ADVENTURING

Märchen Engine is a game of memorable adventure. However, before we can
discuss heroic combat and eldritch sorcery, we must first outline
several topics related to adventuring, including wilderness exploration,
poison, sailing the high seas, and many other day-to-day realities that
await the player characters.

### NPC Reactions

When the player characters encounter a group of NPCs, the Referee will
have already determined the NPCs’ attitudes and plans concerning the
adventurers. However, for any random encounters, or whenever the NPCs'
intentions may not be so clearly defined, the Referee is encouraged to
make a 2d6 Reaction throw and consult the table below. At the Referee's
discretion, an appropriate social skill, or even the characters SOC DM,
may serve as a +DM; for example, the Streetwise skill may positively
affect the outcome of the Reaction roll when dealing with random
criminal elements. Certain Traits may also modify this throw. Additional
DMs may apply at the Referee's discretion subject to the NPCs'
attitudes. Animals have their own reactions, as given in the Monsters
chapter.

Note that a result of 2 is always a violent reaction, and a result of 12
on the dice is always a genuinely friendly reaction.

**Reactions**

| **2D** | **Reaction**              |
|--------|---------------------------|
| 2-     | Hostile, attacks          |
| 3-5    | Unfriendly, may attack    |
| 6-8    | Neutral, uncertain        |
| 9-11   | Indifferent, uninterested |
| 12+    | Friendly, helpful         |

A **Hostile** reaction means that the NPC attacks immediately.

An **Unfriendly** result means that the NPC does not like the PCs and
will attack if they see an advantage and can win the fight.

A **Neutral** result means that the NPC is suspicious and does not hold
a positive attitude towards the PCs, yet can be enticed to begin a
discussion.

An **Indifferent** result means that the NPC will wish to avoid the PCs
or negotiate with them if necessary.

A **Friendly** result means that the NPC likes the PCs and may choose to
cooperate with them voluntarily without promise of reward.

### Time and Movement

In addition to normal measurements of time, such as minutes, hours, and
days, Märchen Engine uses two additional time intervals. The first is
the **round**, often used in combat and spellcasting. A round is 6
seconds. The second interval is the **turn**, which is often used when
exploring ruins, or performing other tasks that are not fast paced, but
still need a discrete measure. A turn is 10 minutes, or 100 rounds.

A human or typical humanoid may move up to 10m in one round if walking,
or 20m if sprinting. A character may sprint for a number of combat
rounds equal to the character's END characteristic before becoming
fatigued. A character may move up to 900m a turn if walking at full
speed, or 1200m a turn if running a long distance (which is slower than
sprinting). Characters may run for a number of turns equal to their END
characteristic before becoming fatigued.

However, when exploring ruins or moving carefully through other terrain
(such as a jungle), characters move at one third of their full speed, 3m
per round or 300m per turn. We recognize that round-to-round movement
rates do not mathematically equate to turn-based movement rates and
fully stand by this decision to make the Referee’s job simpler in
combat.

### Wilderness movement

In the wilderness, an unencumbered human or humanoid may travel 30km a
day on foot on open ground. The Equipment chapter provides details on
travel speeds for mounts and land vehicles such as carts. In any case,
the type of terrain modifies the speed of travel, as follows:

**Terrain effects on wilderness movement**

| **Terrain**              | **Multiplier** |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Desert, hills, woods     | X0.75          |
| Jungle, swamp, mountains | X0.5           |
| Road                     | X1.5           |

Note that some mounts may traverse difficult terrain more easily than
others. For example, a giant lizard travels at full speed through
swamps. See the Equipment chapter for details.

### Getting Lost in the Wilderness

When travelling away from roads, trails, or other known landmarks,
characters may get lost. At the beginning of each day in the wilderness,
make a Survival 6+ or Recon 6+ throw. Use the highest skill level among
the group members. If no such skill is available to the group, it
suffers the usual Unskilled penalty. Hiring a skilled guide might be a
good option in this case.

On a failed skill throw, for each point of Effect on failed the Survival
or Recon throw, the party has gone off track by half a day’s normal
travel distance. Thus, if the throw yielded an Effect of -2, the group
will have lost a full day’s worth of travel in distance. The Referee
could then determine in which direction they went, using a random
direction (see above), or by simply deciding an interesting outcome.

### Rations, Foraging, and Hunting

A person must consume 1kg of food and approx. 4 liters of water per day
of strenuous activity typical of adventuring. Characters may go without
food for 2 days with no significant effect, after which the character
becomes Fatigued and loses 1 point of Endurance per day. Characters who
have not eaten for over 2 days cannot heal any wounds. Consuming enough
food for a day (along the course of the day – not all at once.) restores
the character's ability to heal and removes the Fatigue. Characters who
go without water for a single day are Fatigued and suffer 1D damage per
day afterwards; the character may heal only after consuming one day’s
supply of water.

In most arctic, temperate, or tropical wilderness settings, water is
easy to locate, and should pose no problem to the characters. In a
desert, finding a source of water requires a Survival 8+ throw, made
once a day. Apply DM+1 to this throw in hospitable environments, and
DM-1 in hostile ones, such as deserts.

A character may forage for food while on the road without hindering
travel. For each day of foraging while traveling, throw Survival 10+;
success indicates finding enough food for 1D human-sized creatures. As
above, apply DM+1 to this throw in hospitable environments, and DM-1 in
hostile ones, such as deserts.

In lieu of traveling, a character may attempt to hunt. Throw Survival 8+
once a day to secure enough food for 2D human-sized omnivorous of
carnivorous creatures. However, this is a sole activity per the day and
precludes travel. Furthermore, this results in one wilderness encounter
throw on the appropriate terrain travel while hunting. As above, apply
DM+1 to this throw in hospitable environments, and DM-1 in hostile ones,
such as deserts.

### Climbing and Falling

Assume that all characters can climb reasonable surfaces without much
difficulty if they are not under duress. In a tense situation or when
climbing a difficult surface, throw Athletics 6+ to climb. The Referee
may add further DMs based on the surface being climbed. Generally
speaking, a smooth surface without good handholds will incur DM-1 to
DM-2, while good handholds may grant DM+1 or even DM+2. A slippery
surface incurs a further DM-1.

On a fall, a character suffers 1D damage per 2m fallen, up to 10D at
terminal velocity.

### Fatigue and Rest

A character can become fatigued in numerous ways, including but not
limited to, staying awake for over 24 hours, sprinting (using both
actions for movement) for a number of combat rounds greater than the
character's END characteristic, going without food for over two days, or
even using certain herbs.

A Fatigued character suffers DM-2 to all checks until they rest. The
amount of rest needed is equal to 8 – the character's Endurance DM, in
hours. A negative END modifier means a required rest of over 8 hours.
For example, if a character has an Endurance DM of -1, they would
require 9 hours of rest to remove Fatigue. If a character suffers
fatigue while already fatigued, they suffer a DM-4 to all throws, and
may fall unconscious at the Referee’s discretion.

Periods of rest are also required for healing, as noted in the Damage
and Healing chapter.

### Swimming

Assume that all adventurers know how to swim. Characters move at half
speed when swimming: 5m per combat round or 450m per turn. A character
may swim a number of turns equal to their half END score (rounded down)
before becoming Fatigued. Characters who become Fatigued again (DM-4)
must throw END 6+ every round or drown, unless they reach relative
safety (solid ground or even flotsam).

Note that encumbered characters may drown: A Heavy Loaded character
attempting to swim must throw Athletics 6+ per turn or start drowning. A
drowning character suffers 1D damage per round but may attempt an
Athletics 8+ throw per round to surface again. If the character removes
their load, they will reach the surface easily on an Athletics 6+ throw.

### Light and Darkness

Darkness incurs a DM-2 penalty to all attack throws, while dim light
incurs a DM-1 penalty. A torch or lantern illuminates a 10m radius. A
torch burns continually for one hour (6 turns) while a lantern burns one
flask of oil per 4 hours (24 turns).

Light and darkness affect surprise chances: see the Combat chapter.
Characters carrying light sources in darkness cannot surprise opponents
since their torches or lanterns makes them obvious targets. Characters
in darkness without light sources gain a DM+1 bonus to surprise throws.

### Dungeoneering

Many old-school adventures, especially those written for the Original
Fantasy Role-Playing Game and related games, often occur in underground
dungeons, or ruins. Below are a few notes about running such adventures
in Märchen Engine.

**Breaking through a stock or locked door** requires an STR 8+ throw and
takes 1d6 rounds; or 4+ with an appropriate item used as a battering
ram. This, of course, is very noisy and may alert nearby creatures. The
Referee may rule that the throw is higher or lower based on the door's
strength. **Picking a lock** is a Craft 8+ throw, with modifiers subject
to the Referee’s discretion, customarily based on the lock’s complexity.

**Spotting a secret door or a concealed trap** requires a Recon 8+
throw. This can be subject to modifiers, making the difficulty much
higher in the case of very well-concealed traps. The Referee should not
answer definitively that there are no traps present unless the Effect of
the throw is 6 or higher. In all other cases, the players should be told
that they have not “detected any traps” and proceed accordingly.

### Light and Darkness

Whether underground at any time or in the city’s back alleys at night,
darkness is a common occurrence when adventuring. Well-prepared
adventurers bring with them light sources, such as torches and lanterns.
Such handheld light sources shed light to a 10m radius, with dim light
extending 5m beyond that. Torches burn continuously for 6 turns, while a
lantern burns a flask of oil in 24 turns.

Full darkness incurs a DM-2 to hit targets or to perform other complex
tasks based on sight. In dim light, the penalty is a mere DM-1.

### Disease and Poison

When a character is exposed to a disease or poison, they must make an
END throw. The target is the pathogen’s Virulence number. If successful,
the character shrugs off the effect. If the throw is failed, the disease
damages the character’s END according to the listed damage. The infected
character must repeat this throw after the pathogen’s listed interval.
Success means recovery and failure causes the listed damage, again. If
this damage reduces the character’s END to zero, additional damage
applies to STR or DEX (player’s choice). The character cannot heal this
damage until they recover from the illness or poisoning. Note that most
poisons do not have an interval, but rather cause their damage
immediately upon poisoning and only once.

**Sample pathogens**

|              |               |             |              |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Pathogen** | **Virulence** | **Damage**  | **Interval** |
| Pneumonia    | 6+            | 1D          | 1D weeks     |
| Black Death  | 9+            | 2D          | 1D days      |
| Viper venom  | 10+           | 3D          | \-           |
| Arsenic      | 8+            | 2D          | \-           |
| Sleep poison | 10+           | Unconscious | \-           |

### Extreme Temperatures

Extreme environments damage unprotected characters, as noted in the
table below. If adventurers are properly prepared, either with good
cold-weather gear for arctic climes, or ample supplies of water and
proper clothing for deserts, they can shift one row up or down towards
no damage.

**Extreme Temperatures**

|                 |            |                       |
|-----------------|------------|-----------------------|
| **Temperature** | **Damage** | **Example**           |
| -50°            | 2D/hour    | Deep arctic at winter |
| -25°            | 1D/hour    | Arctic                |
| -24° to 39°     | None       | Typical               |
| 40°             | 1D/hour    | Searing desert        |
| 100°            | 2D/minute  | Boiling point         |

### Fire

When exposed to fire, be that from a burning building or a dragon's
breath, characters must throw DEX 8+ to avoid catching fire. A burning
character takes 2D damage per round. Make another DEX 8+ throw each
subsequent round; if successful, the character puts out the fire. If
failed, the character suffers another 2D damage. Putting out the fire by
other means, such as by jumping into water, will also stop this
continuous damage.

### Optional Rule: Hero Points

The Märchen Engine rules present a world of gritty heroism – heroes
could be, and usually are, mighty – but are still human and constrained
by this harsh reality. However, if you desire larger-than-life heroes
such as John Carter of Mars and the later iterations of Conan the
Barbarian, use the following rule.

Each player starts each game session with 2 personal Hero Points. The
group also has an additional number of Hero Points equal to the number
of player characters present that session.

Each time a player succeeds in a skill or characteristic throw of at
least 8+ with an Effect of 6 or more, the group Hero Points pool gains
another point.

All pools reset at the beginning of each session.

A character may use their personal Hero Points, and with the other
players' consent, points from the group pool.

By spending Hero Points, a character may:

- Reroll any single die throw (including damage). They may take the
  better result.

- Force the Referee to reroll a single NPC's die throw (including
  damage). The second result stands.

- Reroll a throw on a mortal wounds, mishap, mutation, or corruption
  table. They may take the better result.

## Roaming the Seas

Setting sail on an open sea, or even a large river, is a complex
operation. The following rules provide a simple outline for such
adventures.

Ships move across the seas at a daily speed as given on the vehicle
table in the Equipment chapter. This distance is for 12 hours of travel
per day, as is the case of rowed ships traveling along the coastline.
When sailing under a sail, a ship carrying a navigator (Watercraft-3 or
better) may cover twice its daily movement rate.

At the beginning of each day at sea, throw 2D and consult the following
table:

**Sea wind conditions**

| **2D** | **Wind**          | **Sailing speed**   |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 2-3    | Becalmed          | No sailing possible |
| 5      | Light breeze      | 25%                 |
| 6      | Moderate breeze   | 75%                 |
| 7-8    | Average winds     | 100%                |
| 9      | Strong winds      | 125%                |
| 10     | Very strong winds | 175%                |
| 11-12  | Gale              | 200% but see below  |

In a gale, ships may be damaged or sunk. On a seaworthy ship, every
hour, the captain throws Watercraft 8+; on failure, the ship takes one
"hit" of damage (see vehicle combat in the Combat chapter). Galleys and
other rowed vessels automatically take a "hit" every hour, and their
captain must throw Watercraft 6+ every hour to avoid sinking. Galleys in
sight of a coastline when the gale hits can beach to avoid the gale. The
ship may automatically beach on a clear shore, but if the shore is rocky
or otherwise not easily accessible, the captain or navigator must throw
Watercraft 8+ to find a safe harbor and may retry this throw every hour.

### Lost at Sea

At the beginning of each day of water travel, the Referee should make a
Watercraft throw, at a difficulty shown on the table below, using the
ship's navigator's or captain's Watercraft skill. Failure will mean that
the ship will deviate from its course at the Referee's discretion.

**Watercraft navigation**

| **Body of water**   | **Navigation** |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Lake of major river | Watercraft 4+  |
| Coast               | Watercraft 5+  |
| Open sea            | Watercraft 7+  |

### Rations and fishing

Just as in land travel, characters traveling at sea must consume food
and water as noted above. Rowers require 12 liters of water a day rather
than 4 liters. Standard rations are perishable and inedible after a
week, and thus on longer journeys there is need to consume preserved
"iron rations". After one month at sea eating only "iron rations"
without consuming fresh fruit, onions, or potatoes, scurvy takes effect
and the character loses 1 point of END per week; if it reaches zero, the
character dies. A character suffering from scurvy regains 3 points of
lost END per week of eating fresh food.

Characters on a ship which is anchored or floating in relatively mild
seas may fish. Throw Survival 8+ to catch enough fish to feed 2D
human-sized creatures.

# CHAPTER 16: REFEREEING THE GAME

The Referee is the person who takes responsibility for running a Märchen
Engine game. The Referee creates the adventure, runs the players through
it, takes on the roles of the various characters the characters meet,
and handles any questions about the rules. While running the game is a
big responsibility, it's not as hard as it might seem, and providing a
fun and entertaining game for your friends can be quite rewarding.

The rules of Märchen Engine provide a comprehensive outline for the
basic activities confronting any character in the universe you are
creating. These rules are necessarily brief and admittedly omit many
possible activities. After all, a roleplaying game cannot ever attempt
to provide adequate rules that govern the entire universe. In the hands
of players and a Referee, however, the Märchen Engine rules are the
start of dynamic adventures that can range across the universe.

This chapter is about helping you as the Referee run your games. The
advice found within this chapter is completely optional; feel free to
use it or ignore it as you like.

## Rule Zero

Remember that it is just a game. The most important thing in it is to
have fun, both for you and your players, and everything else is
secondary to that. So if a rule, a plot, or even realism and consistency
get in the way of your fun or that of your players, it is your right and
duty as the Referee to change it. As a Referee, you, not the rulebooks,
are the final arbiter in your game. This is a serious responsibility,
but also a great freedom: the freedom to create and run an entertaining
game that suits your needs and the needs of your group. If you and your
players are enjoying yourself, you are doing things right, even if you
are ignoring or modifying the rules and even if your game is not
necessarily realistic or even self-consistent.

With that in mind, the most important rule of the game, dubbed Rule Zero
in the Märchen Engine rules, is that the Referee always has the right to
modify the rules. As a Referee, your rules modifications can be as
simple and improvised as “um, grab some dice, roll them, and tell me the
number” or involve extremely complex home-brew charts that dictate the
smallest of details. This is your game, after all.

## Gaming Style

Every gamer tends to enjoy a specific gaming style. Some people are
consummate “Role-Players”, gaining a lot of pleasure from character
development and interaction. Others are intense “Combat Monkeys”,
finding that an action-packed cinematic frenzy of laser bolts and hand
grenades meets their gaming needs. Some players are “Puzzle Solvers”,
finding the mental challenges of riddles, logic problems, puzzles and
mystery adventures to be the perfect balm. Most of us are a mix of all
of the above, in differing proportions and varying levels of interest
and intensity.

As a Referee, it is recommended that you bear in mind that all styles of
play are valid. If everyone is an action fan, combat-heavy games work
well. Roleplaying the group’s interactions with shopkeepers can be
entertaining, as well. For some, delivering long angst-ridden poetry
in-game can be fulfilling. Intraparty conflict might be a good thing,
with the right group of gamers. Even violating the advice found in these
rules is perfectly okay, so long as the entire gaming group is having
fun. Remember Rule Zero!

Be aware of what you and your players want. If you want something
different from your players, something is going to have to change.
Logically, it should be the group in the minority, which in this case
would be you as the Referee. Similarly, if a single player wants a
different style of play, if it can't be easily integrated, don't force
the issue. Sometimes players or Referees don't fit a particular gaming
group’s style. It does not make anyone wrong; things just did not work
out or come together for that particular game.

## Improvisation

One of the keys to successfully running a Märchen Engine session boils
down to your ability to improvise when circumstances so dictate. You can
certainly plan everything out for your session, to the degree with which
you are comfortable. However, at some point in time, whether
intentionally or accidentally, you are going to have to improvise a
scenario that you did not plan in advance. Maybe the mercenary rolled
poorly in that last combat, dying during the previous encounter, and the
corporate executive that hired the adventurers only made the deal with
him. Perhaps the party decides to pursue another adventure, which you
had not yet prepared, half-way through the current one, based on a clue
they found in the second encounter of the evening. Whatever the reason,
you should be prepared as a Referee to improvise as needed to keep the
session moving.

A common misconception exists that improvisation during a game and
preparation for a game are two opposed approaches. To the contrary, the
more efficiently you prepare for the game, the easier it will be for you
to improvise and “wing it” during actual play. The key to efficient
preparation is not deciding ahead what the characters will do (leave
that to the players), but rather creating material which would both
allow the players to do exciting things and which will allow you to
easily set up challenges, encounters, NPCs, locations and plots that
will fit the flow of the game. This might sound like a lot of work at
first but is actually much simpler, the key here is to create flexible
material which will fit different plot lines, different locations and
different uses with ease.

In today’s world, spare time and inspiration tends to come at unexpected
and irregular times. Carry a small notebook with you. Whenever an idea
for whatever part of your game strikes your mind, jot it down in the
notebook. Later on, when you happen to have a little more spare time,
look these ideas and develop the ones you like a little bit more.
Organize a binder at home (or a directory on your computer), with
different partitions (or electronic files) for NPCs, locations,
creatures, locations and plot hooks. Each item (NPC, location etc) you
develop shouldn't be long, a few sentences per item will work in most
cases (remember that most stats for a character or creature will fit in
a small paragraph, if not a single sentence.) Keep these well-organized
and these could be used whenever you need them in-game or in a
short-term preparation for the game. The same goes for location maps you
happen to doodle during work, while riding public transit or while
attending boring classes or lectures, nothing of this kind should go to
waste.

Most of the adventure elements you prepare, even locations or NPCs
intended to be used in a specific plot line, should be designed in such
a way that it will be easy to 'recycle' these elements for use in
different circumstances in the event you don’t use that element in the
intended plot or location. Players have a tendency to miss the stuff
you've labored hard to create, so be prepared to make a few changes to
all the unused bits and pieces of previous adventures to use in the next
ones.

### Improvisational Preparation

It is definitely possible to prepare in advance for improvisation. It is
suggested that Referees consider preparing the following for their
adventure or campaign:

**A list of random names** for NPCs, locations and vessels can serve any
Referee well. Take them from any source you like, your imagination,
baby-name sites, even phone books, but it always helps to have a quick
source of names for the people and places you have to create on the fly
rather than just calling them “this guy” or “that tower”. That way, when
the characters ask a random citizen for their name, you can easily
choose one from your list, provide it to the group and then cross it
off. Having the ability to name a character or place quickly helps
establish a strong sense of depth and internal consistency within your
setting.

Many Referees also find it helpful to keep **a small collection of
generic locations and encounters** on hand, in case the party decides to
go in an unexpected direction. It is perfectly okay to use adventures or
modules that you find online or in the products you own. If you can
create a few easy-to-place encounters beforehand, this could also prove
to be very useful. Your goal here is simply to have activities for the
characters to do through the rest of the given gaming session. You can
always recoup and plot a better strategy for this new direction the
players have taken between sessions. These little scenarios just give
you a delaying tactic that lets you entertain your players at the same
time.

**A collection of stat blocks** for stock NPCs, perhaps expanding on the
small collection found later in this guide, can provide you with
potential allies, contacts, rivals, enemies, bystanders and potentially
even ready-made player-characters should the need arise over the course
of the gaming session.

Creating **a reference sheet** of the player-characters’ important
combat statistics can help you evaluate the impact of an encounter or
challenge when you have to improvise a scenario on the fly.

A notebook or electronic document for **session notes** can help you
capture the details you’ve created for your campaign or adventure,
either on the fly or through early preparation. With this, you are more
likely to provide a consistent and vibrant gaming experience.

### Recycling Game Material

As preparation time is limited for most Referees, you may find it of
good benefit to maximize your effective use of material and rules while
minimizing the time devoted to creating new non-player characters,
vessels, adventures or locations from scratch. The nature of the Märchen
Engine is of great help here, as the rules are relatively simple and
abstract; a major part of each animal, location, vessel or character is
nothing but narrative, and narrative is easy to change. This is called
“reskinning”. By changing the narrative, the stat block for a veteran
mercenary might be reused as an alien hunter with little or no
modifications to the game mechanics.

A good example is the use of location floor plans. If, for example,
you've downloaded or bought detailed floor plans for a particular
location (or a product including these floor plans) or perhaps you’ve
found them online, you can utilize them in more than one way. If the
floor plans originally detailed the hidden base of some human space
pirates, you can still easily modify them to be used for an alien
fortress, for the remnants of a research facility devastated by a
natural disaster, or even for a private mansion for an eccentric
corporate executive. The map can remain the same, or largely the same,
but the description can change the perception of the players.

## Running the Game

The first rule of the Märchen Engine system is to have fun. A good
Referee will make a reasonable effort to create a gaming experience that
is fun for everyone. The following guidelines might help with that.

### Assigning Difficulties

At the core of every Märchen Engine adventure lies a sequence of tasks
that the character must accomplish in order to succeed. The Referee is
in charge of assigning the difficulty of these tasks, and then
interpreting the outcome. The default is Average (+0). Make a task
easier if you want a particular task to be accomplished, but not be
everyone. This will highlight characters with skill levels in an easy
way. If you want to make a task challenging, but still feel comfortable
with giving the players a good chance of success, set the Difficulty to
Difficult (-2). Reserve Very Difficult (-4) and Formidable (-6) for very
special circumstances, such as attempting the near impossible. As the
Referee, you may not want to say “No” except in the most extreme
circumstances, but assigning a Difficulty of Formidable (-6) is almost
as good, and can create some interesting story developments and a sense
of excited accomplishment should the character succeed.

### Modifying the Roll or the Difficulty

There are two ways of making a task easier or harder: modify the
character's die roll or modify the task's Difficulty. Generally
speaking, circumstances affecting a character's performance, like having
just the right tools for the job or being forced to improvise, apply a
modifier to the die roll. Circumstances making the task easier or harder
to accomplish, like a favorable or unfavorable environment or a
particularly demanding task, modify the Difficulty. If a condition
applies to the character -- like knowledge, health, equipment,
preparedness, and such -- it's usually a die modifier. It doesn't have
to be too fine a line, since modifying the die roll or the Difficulty
amounts to the same thing in the end: the task being easier or harder to
accomplish.

### Circumstance Modifiers

Some circumstances make a check easier or harder, resulting in a bonus
or penalty that is added to the check result. The Referee can alter the
odds of success in two ways:

- If a character has help, such as good tools, competent aids or other
  beneficial circumstances, he receives a +1 bonus to his skill check.

- If a character is hampered, such as having defective tools,
  incompetent assistance or other negative circumstances, he receives a
  -1 penalty to his skill check.

### Automatic Successes

Sometimes it is just easier to assume the character automatically
succeeds at a skill check. If the character has an applicable skill, and
the results of the skill check do not impact the progress of the story,
endanger the character, and the actual success or failure is not
interesting, just assume the character succeeds and move on. Remember,
the Märchen Engine rules suggest that the Referee should only call for
checks:

- When the characters are in danger.

- When the task is especially difficult or hazardous.

- When the characters are under the pressure of time.

- When success or failure is especially important or interesting.

### Using Opposed Checks

Opposed checks are a great way to create tension between two
individuals. Suddenly, the players can target their attention on an NPC,
and that helps with immersion into the game. Should two or more
characters seek to do the same thing at the same time, or to resist one
another’s actions, use an opposed check. The highest check result wins.

## That’s not in the Rules

Sometimes in the course of play, things come up that are not covered in
the rules. When this happens, the Referee is responsible for these
handling situations, making fair evaluations of what the characters do
and deciding what happens as a result. As the Referee, you will need to
quickly improvise a solution. The easiest way to do so is to simply
decide if the suggested action is fun or not, and if it is fun, let it
happen, then throw in a complication that adds to the enjoyment of the
scene. Some Referees prefer a more mechanical approach. Identify a skill
the covers the basic nature of the request, set a Difficulty of Average
(+0) or Difficult (-2), and let them try. If nothing comes to mind
immediately, ask the player to tell you what skill they would use to
accomplish this task. If no skill appears to work, then choose the best
characteristic, and have the player roll a characteristic check. However
you decide to resolve it, the key here is to quickly address the request
and keep the game moving forward.

## Solo Play as Referee Prep Work

Many of the Märchen Engines rule subsystems can be leveraged for solo
play. For Referees, this can turn building a universe of their own into
a game in and of itself. What follows is a list of suggested activities
that can prove to be fun in and of themselves, as well as help Referees
create new material for their personal adventures and campaigns. In
addition, solo play can help Referees learn the rules and become more
proficient for when they run games before a group of players.

Solo play is not limited to Referees. Players can also learn a lot about
and enjoy aspects of the Märchen Engine rules through solo play in those
times when a Referee or gaming group is not currently available.

### Character Creation

A Referee always needs non-player characters. Use the information in
**Chapter 1: Character Creation** to generate new characters. These
characters can easily become future patrons, random encounters, enemies,
allies or simply background characters for a Märchen Engine universe.

### Personal Combat

Take some characters and use the rules from **Chapter 5: Personal
Combat** to practice the combat system. Recreate scenes from science
fiction or action movies using the characters, to get a feel for how the
rules of combat work in various scenarios.

### Starship Construction

Construct some starships and other vessels using the rules in **Chapter
8: Ship Design and Construction**. Build on various scales, to get an
idea of how the different elements of starship construction work
together. You can even use the information under Starship Revenues in
**Chapter 6: Off-World Travel** to determine if your ships would be
economically viable without outside assistance.

### Space Combat

Take some vessels and pit them against one another using the space
combat rules found in **Chapter 10: Space Combat**. Once again, feel
free to recreate scenes from science fiction movies using the vessels,
to get a feel for how the rules of space combat work in various
scenarios.

### Subsector Creation

Using the rules found in **Chapter 12: Worlds**, create a subsector and
identify the systems within it. Generate and record the UWPs for every
system. After the worlds have been created, look over the subsector for
possible communication and trade routes. If you are inspired, create
some background information on the most interesting worlds.

### Animal Encounter Creation

Choose a world from a list of UWPs, and expand on it. Create some maps
of the planet's surface, and the build encounter tables for each terrain
type on the map, using the rules found in **Chapter 13: Planetary
Wilderness Encounters**. If you are so inclined, you can then pit some
characters against the different animals you've created using the
personal combat, so see how they might fare against player characters in
the future.

### Practice Trade and Commerce

Grab a 200-ton TL9 Merchant Trader and use the **Chapter 7: Trade and
Commerce** rules to explore the economic environment of a generated
subsector. Use the rules for passengers, freight and even speculative
trading to get a feel for them. By tracking the revenue and expenses for
the ship, it could give you an idea of where traders will focus their
attentions within the subsector. If this is being played as a solo game,
keep going until either the ship is paid for or the ship goes bankrupt.
This is a good way to validate trade routes, and identify "stepping
stone" worlds between strong markets in a subsector.

### Patron Encounter Creation

The seed of most adventures within a Märchen Engine universe are
captured in patron encounters. Using the details of a subsector's list
of UWPs, create and record some patron encounters using the format found
under **Patron Encounters** in **Chapter 14: Social Encounters**. Think
about science fiction and action-based movies, television shows and
literature, and use those to inspire some of the patron encounters you
create.

# CHAPTER 17: ADVENTURES

Players in a Märchen Engine universe are adventurers, plain and simple.
They will seek out experiences and exploits, reveling in the thrill and
excitement that comes from the pursuit of their goals. Märchen Engine
adventures encompass the potential for adventure that can be found in
classic era science fiction. The opportunities are virtually limitless,
restricted only by the circumstances of the scenario and the
capabilities of the characters. The Referee generates and adjudicates
encounters that make up the building blocks of these adventures. As the
characters move from one adventure to the next, the stories create a
campaign, set against a universe of the Referee's creation. Therein lays
the core of a great roleplaying game experience.

## Conflict

Stories are about conflict. Conflict doesn’t have to be violent, but
without a struggle of some kind, there is no story, and without a story,
there is no true sense of adventure. The key to a great adventure is
conflict. As a Referee, you should make sure you have conflict, and that
the player characters are directly involved in that conflict. If there
isn't any conflict, you lose the impetus for action. If the player
characters aren't directly involved, they are just watching a story,
which sounds more like a movie or a play than a roleplaying game.

Conflict doesn’t have to be physical combat. It could just as easily be
political or corporate intrigue, achieving a specific goal before the
protagonist can either get there first or stop the characters from
succeeding, handling courtly issues of a noble or legal nature,
negotiating a diplomatic resolution to a larger conflict, and much more.

## The Plot

The plot of the adventure is essentially the synopsis of the events that
will transpire over the course of the adventure. You should be able to
sum up the plot of your adventure in one sentence. Knowing your plot
before you begin creating the adventure provides focus and direction,
and creates context for the scenes you will create for your adventure.

If you have problems in coming up with a plot for your adventure, you
might look into Polti’s “The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations.” It’s an
extensive list of basic plots that you can use as the basis for your own
stories and adventures.

## The EPIC Adventure System

The Epic Adventure System provides a way to design and organize
adventures, that incorporates enough flexibility that the player
characters have the 'freedom to roam' without causing the Referee
nightmares. An Epic Adventure is broken down into 6 parts:

- Cast of Characters

- Background

- Minor Scenes

- Plot Keys

- Chapters

- Adventure Checklist

### The Cast of Characters

The Cast of Characters describes the major characters encountered in the
course of the adventure.

### The Background

The Background section provides the Referee with the background
information necessary to properly run the adventure, and lays the
groundwork for introducing this adventure to the players.

### Minor Scenes

Minor Scenes (usually just referred to as 'Scenes') or just Scenes, are
encounters or events that involve the player characters in some form.
Many are directly related to the adventure, and may provide clues,
equipment, or other information and materials needed to eventually
complete the adventure. Others are merely to provide diversion and
amusement. Scenes, unless noted in their descriptions, do not need to be
played in any particular order, and may be sprung upon the player
characters when the Referee deems appropriate.

### Plot Keys

Plot Keys (or simply 'Keys') make up the heart of the storyline for the
adventure. They contain vital pieces to the plot that must be played for
the adventure to make any sense to the players in the end. You may play
any number of Scenes before and after each Plot Keys, but all of the
Plot Keys should eventually be completed in their proper order.

### Chapters

A Chapter (or 'Act') is made up of one of more Plot Keys, and probably
one or more Scenes. They outline the plot to the Referee, and provide
tips and information for playing the Scenes and Plot Keys that are
contained in the Chapter. In order to complete a Chapter, each Plot Key
within must be completed. Each Chapter must be completed, and played in
order to successfully run the adventure.

Because of the 'cinematic' nature of an EPIC adventure, it is easy for
the Referee to allow the player characters to temporarily deviate from
the current adventure storyline to follow a false lead or pursue another
short adventure that has interested them. When the player characters are
ready to return to this adventure plot line, simply pick up with the
next Scene.

### Adventure Checklist

The Adventure Checklist provides the Referees with a recommended
guideline of the order in which various Scenes and Plot Keys in this
adventure should be presented to the players. As the characters complete
each Scene or Plot Key, the Referee simply checks it off the list. When
every Plot Key in a Chapter has been played, that Chapter has been
completed and the Referee may begin the first Scene in the next Chapter.

You will note that not every Minor Scene is included in the Checklist.
This allows Referees who would like to use the Checklist, but would like
to change things a little bit to swap out scenes, or include their own
custom scenes. If you feel comfortable in letting your characters stray
from the order of the Checklist, you may determine the 'cinematic' order
of the scenes as you see fit, or use a weekly events chart like the
Example Weekly Event table to determine the course of events.

This example weekly events chart has been created for an adventure in
which the characters spend several weeks in the outback searching for
lost ruins in the hope of finding historical artifacts.

#### Table: Example Weekly Event

| 2D6  | Weekly Event                                                                                                 |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2-8  | Play a Minor Scene/Find a Ruin                                                                               |
| 9-11 | Starport Run. The Professor has an errand requiring the characters to go to the local starport for the week. |
| 12   | Plot Key                                                                                                     |

Explanation of Example Weekly Event entries:

**Play a Minor Scene**: Select one of the Minor Scenes and run the scene
as directed.

**Starport Run**: This is an excuse and opportunity to bring in sideline
encounters, patrons and scenarios unrelated to this adventure.

**Play a Plot Key**: Plot Keys should be plays in the correct order for
the adventure to make sense to the players. If you change the order of
the Plot Keys, you should be sure to adjust the other scenes to ensure
that the adventure flows properly and makes sense.

## Adventures in Five Acts

Many satisfying adventures have been inspired by the five-act structure
of literary and dramatic creations. Made famous by Gustav Freytag’s
analysis of Shakespearean plays, the five-act structure lends itself
well to basic adventures with only minor modifications.

At its core, the five-act structure for adventures depends on five major
scenes or Plot Keys: the Story Hook and Challenge, the Escalation, the
Complication, the Climax and finally the Reward. Even though this
structure is based on five Plot Keys, you can easily add or subtract as
many minor scenes as the adventure you’re creating calls for. Don’t be
afraid to deviate from this pattern as you become more comfortable with
adventure creation.

### The Story Hook

The key to the opening scene of any adventure is action. The story hook
Plot Key should therefore be an action scene, involving either combat or
some form of physical challenge. This draws the characters into the main
conflict of the adventure’s plot, and introduces the party to agents of
the main antagonist. As this scene is wrapping up, you can either
provide clues to the direction of the next Plot Key, or introduce a
minor scene that ultimately points the party in the direction of the
final climax of the adventure.

### The Escalation

Now that you’ve met the needs of your more action-oriented players, you
should create a series of roleplaying scenes or puzzle challenges that
further escalate the plot, leading ultimately to a Plot Key that helps
the players form a plan of attack for reaching the climax of the
adventure. This allows non-combat characters an opportunity to shine.
Investigation and information gathering make for excellent scenes in
this regard. In addition, it provides the full roleplaying experience to
the players, emphasizing why the group is playing a roleplaying game
instead of a board game.

### The Complication

Nothing is ever as straight-forward as it seems. The third major Plot
Key introduces a complication to the party in fulfilling the needs of
the plot. This Plot Key often requires the characters to expend
resources, forcing them to decide on whether to spend their resources on
this particular challenge or the big climactic challenge that is coming
up next. In addition, this scene often introduces a plot twist or
restriction that makes the resolution of this challenge and/or the
climax that much harder.

### The Climax

This Plot Key is the final showdown, the final fight with the primary
antagonist of this story and his minions. This scene is most often a big
fight or confrontation, but under the right circumstances, it could be a
social or mental challenge instead. This is the big scene where everyone
should have a chance to shine. It is suggested that this scene require a
challenge more complex than “kill everyone”, even if it’s as simple as
“kill everyone without any collateral damage to property or other
persons”. If the climax is a combat scene, the site for the climax
should also include at least two different terrain features, to provide
for some interesting situations that make such scenes memorable. While
you don’t want to overdo yourself, you also want to make this scene feel
more exciting or important than the other scenes in the adventure.

### The Reward

This scene is the dénouement, where the plot is wrapped up and the
characters receive their reward for their victory, or experience the
consequences of their failure, on those occasions where things didn’t
necessarily work out. Often in Märchen Engine adventures, the reward is
monetary. However, characters might instead earn titles, receive ship
shares, gain political support, earn some form of social advantage,
recover lost or hidden information, or even learn a campaign secret that
could change the face of the world forever. Sometimes, there’s a final
plot twist here, such as a secret guardian guarding the reward or a
false reward serving as a distraction from the true reward of the
adventure. If you have ideas for a future scenario you’d like to offer
the players, you can even drop the first hints of things to come in the
reward scene, giving the characters motivation to pursue the clues that
may well lead to their next daring adventure.

### Other Suggestions

When creating your own adventures, keep things dense and concise. You
will find that players have a knack for complicating things all by
themselves, so don't feel a need to include a lot of false leads and
irrelevant details. You can always improvise the additional of extra
scenes as the need arises, but it is hard to work around a large number
of required scenes if the adventurers suddenly take the adventure in a
totally different direction.

## The Three-Dimensional Campaign

Unless you're running a “one-shot” adventure, put in the effort to keep
your setting, plot and adventure three-dimensional. That is, even if
your campaign has a very strong overarching plot, not everything has to
be tied in it directly. For example, if your campaign revolves around a
massive struggle between two interstellar polities, there should be some
NPCs, sub-plots, protagonists and even organizations that don't work
directly (if at all) for any side of the overarching conflict. Not every
protagonist in your game has to serve the enemy government, and not all
good guys have to get along together very well.

The reason for this, besides realism, is that both you and your players
will eventually want to take a break from the main plot and do something
else, especially during a long campaign. Sometimes you'll want, say, to
steal a high-tech prototype, and that research facility belongs to a
third interstellar government that remains outside the overarching
conflict; sometimes you'll just want to explore an old, forgotten ruin
uncovered in the wilderness of a backwater planet, a place unrelated to
the main plot. Besides, making two factions work together against a
common enemy despite hating each other with a passion could be a cool
adventure, and so could be playing one opposing faction against another
without getting caught.

### The Rule of Three

As a general rule of a thumb when creating background elements involved
in conflicts, such as organizations, factions, political figures, etc.,
you will best be served by creating three of them. For example, when
you're designing a power struggle in an interstellar government, you
should probably have three factions. The typical war can be created with
three opposing sides, even if one of them is simply a large band of
pirates with goals at odds with the two “official” sides. Creating three
elements vying for the same goal creates a greater degree of dynamic
complexity, allowing for adventures that explore the different
relationships between the three elements without reducing the conflict
to a simple “black-and-white”, two-dimensional confrontation. Three
sides give you plenty of opportunity to explore shifting alliances,
subversive practices, negotiations, alternate paths to personal success
and greater variety in your scenarios.
