# INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the ***Märchen Engine System Reference Document***, which
outlines the core rules used by this Open Gaming System. This
Introduction provides you with an overview of what the Märchen Engine is
and how it works, while the later chapters show you how to create
characters and embark on your own exciting adventures.

## What Is Roleplaying?

If you are new to roleplaying, you might be asking yourself, “What is a
roleplaying game?”

A roleplaying game (sometimes abbreviated as RPG) is a game in which
players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players
take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative,
either through literal acting or through a process of structured
decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many
games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and
guidelines, such as the Märchen Engine rules.

A session of Märchen Engine play is conducted through discussion. One
player, the Referee, usually arbitrates any decision based on the rules
and presents the setting of the game, while each of the other players
plays the role of a single character. Together, the Referee and players
create a story, much like the way many of us used to create stories
playing games of make believe as young children, except with more dice
and more structure.

## What Is the Märchen Engine?

The Märchen Engine is simply a set of rules for conducting a game based
on classic fiction and adventure stories. Within its pages, you will
find rules on creating characters, resolving tasks, fighting other
creatures and engaging in huge battles, building worlds, enjoy the risks
of speculative trading, exploring new worlds, and a host of other
diverse activities. Although no rules set can be complete, the Märchen
Engine attempts to provide enough rules to allow you to create almost
any science fiction adventure.

The Märchen Engine is inspired by classic fiction games from the early
days of roleplaying and shares a lot of similarities with these gaming
systems. Material from these older rules sets and those created under
the Märchen Engine are mutually compatible with only a minimum of
adjustments required.

To play, you need a copy of the Märchen Engine rules; several dice,
available at game and hobby stores (you'll need two at a minimum, but
more is better); and a pencil and some paper.

## The Core Task Resolution System

The Märchen Engine uses a core task resolution system to resolve
actions. Whenever your character attempts any action with a chance of
failure, do the following:

1.  Roll dice as determined by the characters and their circumstances.

2.  Add any relevant modifiers (for things like characteristics, skills,
    difficulty and circumstances).

3.  If the result equals or exceeds the threshold for success, the
    action succeeds. If the result is lower than the threshold for
    success, the action fails.

This simple system is used for nearly everything in the Märchen Engine,
with variations based on the modifiers added to a roll and the effects
of success and failure.

## The Referee

Within the Märchen Engine rules, one of the players is asked to assume
the mantle of Referee. The Referee is the person who will act as an
organizer, officiant for questions regarding rules, arbitrator, and
moderator for a Märchen Engine gaming session, or an ongoing Märchen
Engine campaign. The role of the Referee is to weave the other
participants' player-character stories together, control the non-player
aspects of the game, create environments in which the players can
interact, and solve any player disputes.

## The Characters

A player character or playable character (PC) is a fictional character
in a Märchen Engine game whose actions are directly controlled by a
player of the game rather than the rules of the game. The characters
that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters
(NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by
the Referee.

Using the Märchen Engine rules as guidelines, a player will create a
character reflecting the sort of role they’d like to have in the game.
The character is usually of a certain race (depending on those available
with the Referee's universe) and possesses a unique combination of
skills and levels of expertise. The attributes of a character is given
as numerical values which can change as the gamer progresses, and
characters grow and develop over the course of their adventures.

### Aspects

All beings have four aspects of their existence. These define the
highest categorical breakdown of a being. They are Physical, Mental,
Social, and Spiritual. They each have a numeric score The higher the
score, the more potential that being has in that aspect of their
existence. These aspects can be broken down into your traditional
Characteristics.

### Characteristics

All characters have certain basic characteristics that define what they
can do. Each of these characteristics fall into a given aspect. Higher
characteristic scores grant bonuses on task resolution checks, while
lower characteristic scores grant penalties. As part of creating your
character, you decide how strong, smart, and tough your character is by
choosing the appropriate characteristic scores. See **Chapter 1:
Character Creation** for more information.

### Skill

Skills represent exposure and/or training in a particular sort of task
or knowledge. Initially you are either trained or untrained in that
skill. Overtime you will gain additional points in the skill as you
excel in your specialization. Skills themselves are not associated with
a given technology level. Skills cannot be above level 4. Once you have
a skill at level 1, you have all associated specializations at level 0.

### Specializations

Every Skill has multiple specializations associated with it. When a
skill is initially learned at level 1 selected it means that all the
specializations associated with it are all at level 0. From that point
on, the any additional study in that skill will require the player to
pick a specialization to study instead. They will start that skill at
level 1. A character may have multiple specializations in a skill.

Each cascade skill level represents roughly two years’ worth of
education and training in that skill. For skills of an academic bent,
you could equate that to an associate degree (or similar two-year
academic program) at level one, a bachelor’s degree (120 hours or other
four-year program) at level two, a master’s degree at level three(40
hours) of experience, a Doctorate at level four(60 hours and beyond).
Once a cascade skill is taken to level 4, the skill its associated with
receives a +1. CascadeSkills are learned at a technology level. Cascade
skills can not be learned past level 4.

Skill levels act as a bonus on task resolutions rolls when a character
attempts an action related to a skill. As your character follows their
career, they gain skills. See **Chapter 2: Skills** for more information
on specific skills.

Being trained in that skill represents roughly two years’ worth of
education, training, and exposure , everything from acrobatic maneuvers
to negotiation, piloting a starship, and programming a computer. Someone
trained in athletics is able to climb faster and with more confidence
than someone who isn't, for example. Skills are measured in levels,
reflecting how much training a character has in the skill. When
recording skills and their associated levels, the skill name is written
first, followed by a hyphen, and then the number of levels that the
character possesses in that skill. For example, Gambling-2 means that
the character has two levels of Gambling skill.

##### Table: Skill and Specialization Level 

\## 5 - Apotheosis

Once a character has entered into the state of Apotheosis, they gain the
ability to convert ability scores into successes. They also gain the
ability to transfer or consume ability scores from lesser characters.
{Expand}

Stats as an EV as a commoner + Skill level as an apprentice vs. a target
number plus the ability to start a task chain plus the ability to pool
excess successes for future. Plus the ability to convert ability scores
into successes by taking damage to them.

### Careers

As a part of their development, characters follow certain life paths
called careers. The Märchen Engine provides a variety of career options
for characters to pursue, which opens up opportunities for characters to
gain skill levels, characteristic boosts and significant mustering out
benefits before they enter into play. See **Chapter 1: Character
Creation** for more information.

## Game Play

Playing a session using the Märchen Engine rules resembles verbally
acting out chapters from a story. Game sessions can last from short
sessions of an hour or two, up to marathon games covering most of a
weekend. The average game session tends to run three to five hours,
however. Over the course of a session, the player-characters pursue
their adventures. Some resolve quickly, within a single session, while
others may take place in multiple acts spread out over several sessions.

Each adventure is like its very own story, consisting of a series of
scenes that are explored during play. In general, most scenes are simply
the players interacting with the non-player characters and the universe
created by the Referee. The players describe their actions, and the
Referee describes the results of those actions, in a back-and-forth
exchange. Certain kinds of situations, such as personal or space combat,
have more structure and more rules to help the players resolve their
actions in ways reflecting the abilities of their characters.

### Game Play Processes

The basic idea The Märchen Engine is to separate the Game Play Processes
from the Game Mechanics. A Game Play Process are the steps the players
go through to perform a given narrative sequence with their characters.
While a Game Play Mechanic is how to resolve any action the players wish
to perform.

#### The Basic Game Play Process

1\. The Referee establishes a scene based on the characters skills,
abilities, and circumstances.

2\. The players state what their characters are trying to achieve and
how they are doing it.

3\. The Referee determines if the approach automatically succeeds or
automatically fails to achieve the goal.

4\. If success or failure is not automatic, then the people at the table
determine success by rolling dice.

5\. The Referee narrates the results and the consequences based on the
characters skills, abilities, and circumstances (which generally
includes marking off resources spent in the attempt).

6\. Goto Step 2

#### Other Game Play Processes

### Game Play Mechanics

#### Die Rolls 

The Märchen Engine allows play players to pick between several different
mechanics to resolve actions. They are as follows: D10, D20, D100, 2d6,
3d6, and 4d7.

Using the Märchen Engine, when you have to make a die roll to resolve an
action, it will typically follow the core system of a 2D6 roll plus
modifiers versus a target of 8+ (read as eight or higher). This is
called a check. You always want to roll high on a check. Rolling 12
before adding modifiers (where two sixes appear on the dice naturally)
is not an automatic success and rolling 2 before adding modifiers (where
both dice show a one naturally) is not an automatic failure.

##### Difficulty and Effect

A check's Difficulty is a number set by the Referee that modifies your
check result. When no Difficulty is given, the assumed Difficulty is
DM+0. So, for a task with a Difficulty of DM+2, you must add +2 to the
check result. You succeed on a total of 8 or better. The list of
Difficulty ratings can be found in the Task Difficulty table

###### Table: Task Difficulties

| Difficulty        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | D10 | D20 | D100 | 2d6 | 3d6 | 4d7 |

In some cases, the consequences of a check vary based on how much the
check result is above or below the target of 8. The difference between
the check result and the target of 8 is called the Effect. If the Effect
is 6 or higher, the check is considered an Exceptional Success. When the
Effect is -6 or lower, the check is considered an Exceptional Failure.
See **Chapter 2: Skills** for more details.

##### Degrees of Effect Defined

There are nine separate ways a predicament can be resolved:

###### Fail Catastrophically 

This is a critical failure. The cost for this sort of failure means the
outcome the actor was intending failed. Additionally, things have turned
worse for that actor as well in unrelated areas or with a sense of
finality.

> For example, if a thief was attempting to pick the lock of a door,
> then it should be determined that they did not pick the lock. The trap
> in the door was triggered. Everyone in the party must now determine if
> they are now poisoned, and no further attempts may be made (finality).
> In the event that overcoming this complication was required for the
> party to accomplish their overall objectives, the GM must instead make
> the events turn to the worse in other areas. In the above example this
> would mean that in their attempts to pick the lock, the thief slipped,
> and knocked the torch out of the hands of the person carrying it, and
> the tapestry the door is behind is now on fire. Or the torch is now
> out and no one can see. The idea here is to heighten tension and make
> the attempt require larger efforts of heroics.

###### Costly

This is one step away from a critical failure. The cost should be
related to the outcome the player or monster was attempting.

> For example, if the thief was attempting to pick the lock of a door,
> then it should be determined that they did not pick the lock, but they
> did trigger the trap in the door, and everyone in the party must now
> determine if they are poisoned.

###### Fail

This is a normal failure.

> In the example of our thief would not have been able to pick the lock,
> but the lock would not be jammed, and he would still have his pick.

###### Fail in Style

This is one step above a failure. It is still a failure, but something
else has happened that moves the story forward in a more difficult path,
but without accomplishing the goals.

> In the example of the thief, he wouldn't have picked the lock, but he
> did spring the trap and the door was opened, but everyone in the party
> must determine if they are poisoned. This is the classic fail forward
> approach.

###### Tie

A tie succeeds unless this was a contest between two parties, in which
case the outcome is that neither party gets what they want, and it
should be treated as a fail in style for both sides. This is useful for
social interactions or for contests of strength or agility.

> In the example of our thief the parties in question are the designer
> of the lock or door and the party trying to get in. The thief would
> not get what they want, the lock to be picked, and the designer of the
> lock would not get what they want, to keep the lock secure. The
> resolution on this would be that the thief can’t open the lock with
> this action, but he has gained knowledge of the lock, which will make
> it easier for him next time. This wouldn’t be a problem for the thief
> uness he was doing this under a stress.

###### Succeed

The individual who attempted to do something accomplishes what they set
out to do.

> In the example of the thief, the door is unlocked, and is no longer
> being held shut by the locking mechanism.

###### Succeed in Style

The individual who attempted to do something accomplishes what they set
out to do, and they got some hidden bonus or style out of it.

> In the example of the thief, the door is unlocked, and is no longer
> being held shut by the locking mechanism, and the thief now
> understands how that lock is constructed and the next one that is just
> like it will be easier to open.

###### Critical Success

The individual who attempted to do something accomplishes what they set
out todo, and they got a substantial hidden bonus or style out of it.

> In the example of the thief, the door is unlocked, and is no longer
> being held shut by the locking mechanism, and the thief now
> understands how locks made by that locksmith are constructed so any
> lock within this facility will be easier to open.

###### Serendipitous Success

The individual who attempted to do something accomplishes what they set
out todo, and they got a substantial hidden bonus or style out of it
that is completely unrelated to the task being attempted.

> In the example of the thief, the door is unlocked, and is no longer
> being held shut by the locking mechanism, and the thief now
> understands how locks made by that locksmith are constructed so any
> lock within this facility will be easier to open. In addition, the
> thief see's the trap on the door as well, and has a normal success to
> disarm it. The best way to see a Serendipitous success is to see this
> as two completely independent successes on one die roll. In the event
> that a complication requires more than one success a Serendipitous
> success will, in addition to everything above, add an additional
> success to the success pool.

#### Types of Checks 

There are Two main types of checks: skill checks and characteristic
checks.

##### Passive Checks

A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve
any die rolls by the players. Such a check can represent the average
result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors
over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly
determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling
dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.

Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:

10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check

##### Active Checks

###### Aspect Checks

An aspect check is the most simple check you can make.

###### Characteristics Checks

A characteristic check is like a skill check, but measures raw ability,
like strength, endurance, or intelligence. These checks are used when
the task is one not covered by an obvious skill, or where the
character’s innate abilities are the most important influence on the
result. To make a Characteristic check, you must roll 2D6 and add the
appropriate characteristic score modifier. Characteristic checks tend to
be all or nothing (you can either accomplish the task or you can't),
although there are sometimes gradations of success or failure.

###### Skill Checks

A skill check determines what you can accomplish with a particular skill
(sometimes whether you're trained in that skill or not). You will roll
the dice. Then you will take that number and add any sort of modifiers
based on your characters aspects, characteristics, skills and
specializations. Finally you will add any sort of difficulty modifier
based on the circumstances of what your character is trying to do. Then
you will compare the resulting number against the Degree of Effect to
see the outcome in that circumstance. Most of the times, skill checks
have gradations of success and failure based on the Effect of your check
result. When making a skill check, if a character does not have any
levels in the required skill, then they suffer a the untrained penalty.

###### Specialization Checks

###### Untrained and Zero-Level Skills

Characters can perform some tasks without any training in a skill, using
only raw talent (defined by their characteristic scores), but skilled
characters tend to be better at such things. Unless the Referee says you
cannot, you can always attempt tasks involving that skill even if you
have no training in it.

If a character has no level in a skill, then he is untrained and will
suffer a –3 Dice Modifier when trying to use that skill.

If a character has zero level in a skill (Skill 0), then he is competent
in using that skill, but has little experience. He does not get any
bonus from his skill ranks when using that skill but at least he avoids
the penalty for being untrained.

###### Multiple Actions

A character can try to do two or more things at once, like firing a
spacecraft’s weapons while also flying, or disarming a bomb while hiding
from guards. For every extra thing that the character is doing, he
suffers a –2 DM to all skill checks.

###### Local Law Level

Some tasks are impacted by the local Law Level, as presented in the
Universal Settlement Profile. For tasks that are impacted by the local
laws, rules and regulations, check the table below and use these as a
part of the DM’s that are added to the die roll prior to determining the
effect.

####### Table: Base Difficulty by Law Level

| Law Level | Difficulty     |
|-----------|----------------|
| 0         | Routine        |
| 1-3       | Average        |
| 4-6       | Difficult      |
| 7-9       | Very Difficult |
| 10+       | Formidable     |

###### Attack Rolls

There is no separate Attack roll in the Märchen Engine. You will use a
standard skill check and the circumstances and skills of the
participants will determine various numbers you add to the result you
get on your dice.

###### Opposed Checks

If two characters are opposing each other directly in a task, then the
character who obtains the highest Effect wins. For ties on opposed
checks, the character with the highest relevant characteristic score
wins. If the characters tie on characteristic scores, they reroll.

#### Other Rules about Checks

##### Trying Again

In general, you can try a check again if you fail, and keep trying
indefinitely. Some tasks, however, have consequences for failure. For
example, failing an Athletics check while climbing a cliff might mean
you fall, which might make it difficult to try again. Some tasks can't
be attempted again once a check has failed. For most tasks, once you've
succeeded, additional successes are meaningless. (Once you've discovered
a computer account's password using the Computer skill, for instance,
there's no further benefit from additional Computer checks to determine
the account's password.)

##### Circumstance Modifiers

Some circumstances make a check easier or harder, resulting in a bonus
or penalty that is added to the check result. The Referee can alter the
odds of success in two ways:

- If a character has help, such as good tools, competent aids or other
  beneficial circumstances, he receives a DM+1 bonus to his skill check.

- If a character is hampered, such as having defective tools,
  incompetent assistance or other negative circumstances, he receives a
  DM-1 penalty to his skill check.

##### Time and Checks

Outside of stressful situations such as combat, performing a particular
task often takes a random amount of time, depending on circumstances.
For most tasks, roll 1D6 and multiply it by the increment that the
Referee provides for that action. For example, breaking a flimsy wooden
door down may only require 1D6 seconds, while performing delicate
surgery might take 1D6 hours. During combat, most actions are more
refined to a finite period. Some of these actions are considered minor
actions, while others are deemed significant actions. More information
is provided in **Chapter 5: Personal Combat**.

You can choose, before you roll, to move up or down one or two rows on
the Time Frames table. Moving up (reducing the time increment) gives you
a –1 DM for every row you move; moving down and increasing the time
taken gives you a DM+1 for every row you move. Your Referee will help
adjudicate any issues that might arise from a change in the time frame.

###### Table: Time Frames

| Time Frame      | Base Increment                                             |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1D6 seconds     | One second                                                 |
| 1D6 rounds      | One personal combat round (6 seconds)                      |
| 1D6 minutes     | One minute (60 seconds, or 10 personal combat rounds)      |
| 1D6 kiloseconds | One kilosecond (\~16.67 minutes, or one space combat turn) |
| 1D6 hours       | One hour (60 minutes)                                      |
| 1D6 days        | One day (24 hours)                                         |
| 1D6 weeks       | One week (7 days)                                          |
| 1D6 months      | One common month (30-31 days)                              |
| 1D6 quarter     | One quarter (3 common months)                              |

##### Aiding Another

Sometimes characters work together and help each other out. In this
case, one character (usually the one with the highest total of modifiers
on the check) is considered the leader of the effort and makes the check
normally, while each helper makes the same check. The Effect of a
helper's check result can provide either a bonus (DM+1 with a successful
result, DM+2 with an Exceptional Success) or a penalty (DM-1 with a
failed result, DM-2 with an Exceptional Failure) to the leader's check
result. In many cases, outside help isn't beneficial, or only a limited
number of helpers can aid someone at once. The Referee limits aid as
appropriate for the task and conditions.

##### Task Chaining 

TASK CHAINS

Often, players will find themselves performing a series of interlinked
tasks or working as a group.

Finding a buyer for a cargo of illegal goods, for example, calls for a
Streetwise check to find a fence, then a Broker check to negotiate a
price. The result of the Streetwise check could conceivably influence
the quality and competence of the fence, which will affect the Broker
check.

Alternatively, when coming up with a plan to attack a fortress, the
players would begin with a Recon check to scope the place out, then a
Tactics check to find weak spots in its defenses, then Stealth and
Electronics rolls to get past the security system. The quality of
information gleaned from the Recon check will certainly have an impact
on the tactics the players choose to adopt, and this in turn will make
their Stealth checks easier or harder, and so on.

When tasks are linked together like this they are called task chains and
the result of one check can give a DM to the next – for better or worse.
This DM is equal to the σ value on their results on the degree of effect
table.

##### Group Checks

When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a
group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation,
the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who
aren’t.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability
check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.
Otherwise, the group fails.

Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all
the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers
are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Survival check to
see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other
natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds,
the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of
danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.

##### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage
or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll.
When that happens, you roll a second set of dice when you make the roll.
Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower
roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and
roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll
those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or
imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional set
of dice. If three favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you
still roll only one additional set of dice.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage,
you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one set of
dice. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage
and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you
have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game lets
you reroll some of all of your dice, you can reroll a single instance of
those dice; either the advantaged roll or the disadvantaged roll) one of
the dice.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special
abilities, actions, or other actions. The GM can also decide that
circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant
advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

##### The Dice Chain

One of the most fun aspects of using funky dice in a rules set is
getting to roll those dice! Many traditional RPGs utilize modifiers to
dice rolls to express improved success or failure in an action. For
example, an attack with an off-hand weapon may incur a -4 penalty, or an
attack against a motionless opponent may grant a +4 bonus.

The Märchen Engine utilizes this traditional modifier system but can
also employ a system of swapping out die types where the modifier is
sufficiently large. If the team has decided to use the 3d6 as the core
die mechanic, there are times when the player may be instructed to roll
a 3d6 or 4d7 instead, depending on whether the action has an improved or
reduced chance of success.

Sometimes there will be multiple “dice swaps” impacting a die. For
example, a spellcaster may be particularly good at one kind of magic,
granting him an improved die, and he may also be operating under the
influence of a magic item that grants him a further improved die. The
system for moving “up and down” different die types is known as the dice
chain.

The dice chain is represented as follows:

d3–d4–d5–d6–d7–d8–d10–d12–d14–d16–d20–d24–d30

##### Technology Level

Technology Level, also known as Tech Level or TL, is a measure how
advanced a given technology or Scientific idea is and is frequently a
measure of the complexity and effectiveness of a piece of equipment.
Most skills that deal with technology or scientific ideas also have a
technology level they are learned at. When a player wishes to use a
piece of technology that is built to be used by another technology level
the player needs to add a negative DM for each difference.

> For Example, a Player who was raised in the Bronze age comes across a
> iPhone and they attempt to use it. The Technology Level of the iPhone
> is TL8 and the TL of the Bronze Age High Priest is TL1. This means the
> player adds a DM-7 to their die roll do this activity. Another player
> whose character is from our day and age is shown a bronze age carved
> tablet where the laws of their society are written. The modern-day man
> learned at TL8 and is attempting to use a TL1 object. This is still a
> DM-7 to try to understand the laws written on the stone tablets on
> display in front of the tent of worship in the center of the nomadic
> encampment.

universes.

## The Combat Round

When things really start happening in a Märchen Engine game, time is
broken down into six-second segments called rounds, or combat rounds,
since they're most often used in fights. A round isn't very much time,
just long enough for a character to do something. The types of actions
your character can perform during a round are significant actions, minor
actions, extended actions, free actions, and reactions. During a round
you can do one of the following:

- Initiate or continue an extended action.

- Take a significant action and a minor action.

- Take three minor actions and forego taking a significant action this
  turn.

You can perform as many free actions and reactions in a round as you
wish, although the Referee may choose to limit them to a reasonable
number to keep the game moving. See **Chapter 5: Personal Combat** for
more information.

##### Physical Sciences / Survival Skill 

Your Physical Sciences check measures your ability to recall lore about
terrain, the weather, and natural cycles as well as perform mathematical
operations. You might be asked to make a Survival check to navigate and
find a path within a given environment, follow tracks, hunt wild game,
guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears
live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural
hazards. This skill is also used in urban environments to survive on the
streets and to live within that environment.

##### Investigation Skill 

When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues,
you make an Investigation check. You might deduce the location of a
hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of
weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could
cause it to collapse.

##### Perception Skill 

Your character's Perception check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise
detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of
your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you
might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under
an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you
might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they
are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an
alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

##### Formal Sciences Skill 

Your Formal Science skill is used when you are attempting to understand
any formal system such as logic, mathematics, statistics, information
theory, game theory, or decision theory. This skill is also used in
conjunction with another skill when someone wishes to advance the craft
of that other skill formally.

their own actions to create the outcomes they want.

##### Deception Skill

A Deception check determines whether you can convincingly hide the
truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can
encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling
outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard,
con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a
disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a
straight face while telling a blatant lie.

##### Persuasion Skill

When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact,
social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Persuasion

inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

### Spirituality Aspects

#### Skepticism Characteristics 

**Skepticism** represents the overall ability of the being to manipulate
the spiritual powers as laws of nature

##### Arcana Skill 

Arcana takes the scientific method and applies it to the spiritual
realm. A Gnostic would focus on understanding the knowledge and theory
of how something worked, while an arcanist would focus on making a
workable system that predicts outcomes. It is skeptical of magic being
personal or aligned to ideals, creatures, or others. It's Math and
Formula. This is the magic of the traditional RPG Mage."

##### Gnosis Skill 

Gnosis is a focus on the spiritual realm that insists that understanding
and knowledge and the abandonment of the physical are the keys to
enlightenment, power, and individual and personal monergism. This is
about the person themselves and achieving enlightenment and escape from
the physical realms. Advanced practitioners may not be fully self
focused. This is the magic of the Guru and the Hermit."

##### Chaos Skill

Chaos magic understands that the universe is unique and every
circumstance needs to be addressed uniquely. Chaosism attempts to
harness the random aspects of a circumstance to the advantage of the
caster. This is the magic of trickster, the bard, and the storm.

#### Faith Characteristics

**Faith** represents the overall ability of the being to trust in the
promises of other beings

##### Theurgy Skill 

This collection of skills is associated with interactions with other
spiritual beings. These are generally rituals and practices that form
the interactions and bargains that are made between those intelligent
creatures that live within the spirit realm and who are capable of
various bargains or contracts. This is traditional Clerical Magic and
warlock magic."

##### Adept Skill

This collection of skills is associated with having an understanding
one's own personal spiritual power and skills. An Adept is someone who
has perfected their understanding of their spiritual strengths and
weaknesses and uses them to enhance their body, mind, and social
interactions. This is the magic of martial arts. It's chief focus is the
caster itself, and not some other ideal or other creature, while a
martial art form may be inspired by some living creature or force of
nature, the goal of the Adept is self improvement and mastery not to
become that creature. "

##### Order Skill 

Order is the study of how the spiritual realms are ordered, predictable,
and outcomes are controlled. This is the magic of the Paladin who is
aligned to dieties or other cosmic powers."

#### Mystery Characteristics 

**Mystery** represents the overall ability of the being to harmonize
conflicts in their understanding of the spiritual realms by pushing
themselves.

##### Metaphysics Skill 

Someone who uses Metaphysics is trying to understand the pathways
through time and space with a focus on knowing the substance, cause, and
identity of the spiritual aspects of reality. This is the magic of the
Oracle, ESP, and Psionics.

##### Animism Skill 

Animism is the understanding that the whole universe itself is imbued
with spiritual power. Someone who uses Animism understands these powers
and uses them to shape the world around them. Some Animists focus on
philosophical ideals such as peace, change, love, honor, etc. and try to
order everything toward increasing that ideal everywhere. Others will
focus on a cosmostological ideals that about the spiritual composition
of matter and attempt to shape and control that. This is the magic of
the Jedi and other non-religiously affiliated paladins. This is the
magic of the artificer and the elementalist.

##### Shamanism Skill 

Shamanism is the understanding of and confirming one's own spiritual
strengths and weaknesses to mirror the Physical, Mental, Social, and
Spiritual aspects of other living creatures. This is the magic of the
Druid or the Shaman. This is also the magic of the shapeshifters and
doppelgangers.

## Pseudo-Hexadecimal Notation

The Märchen Engine uses a form of pseudo-hexadecimal notation as a type
of shorthand in noting specific values of characteristic scores, world
statistics, drive type designations and similar design elements. The
pseudo-hexadecimal notation proceeds as normal for values from 0 to 15,
but extends beyond F for 15, with G for 16, etc. The Märchen Engine
skips the use of the letters I and O, because they might be mistaken for
the numbers 1 and 0. The Pseudo-Hexadecimal Notation table provides a
quick reference for converting values for use in Märchen Engine.

#### Table: Pseudo-Hexadecimal Notation

| Actual Value | PseudoHex |
|--------------|-----------|
| **0**        | 0         |
| **1**        | 1         |

except for the titles of products published by Ziefen Presse, and the

**Designation of Product Identity**

Any title of a product published by Ziefen Presse is designated as
Product Identity.

***The following is an important notice***:

This Product is derived from the Traveller System Reference Document and
other Open Gaming Content made available by the Open Gaming License, and
does not contain closed content from products published by either
Mongoose Publishing or Far Future Enterprises. This Product is not
affiliated with either Mongoose Publishing or Far Future Enterprises,

## Publishing Your Own Materials

As you can see at the beginning of this System Reference Document, all
of the text in this document is designated as Open Gaming Content,
except for the titles of products published by Samardan Press, and the
trademarks "Cepheus Engine" and "Samardan Press".

This means you can copy whatever parts of the Cepheus Engine you want,
add your own content, change the content around, and publish the result.
Note that you will have to comply with the Open Gaming License, as
reproduced at the end of this document. If you don't mention any of the
trademark elements, you don't need to do anything else.

However, you can use the "Cepheus Engine" trademark, under certain
circumstances, to indicate compatibility with this rules system. You
have to follow the requirements of the Cepheus Engine
Compatibility-Statement License (CSL), but if you do, you can state that
your published material "is compatible with the rules of Cepheus Engine"
or, "with the Cepheus Engine rules" or, "with the Cepheus Engine game."
Here are those requirements:

### The Cepheus Engine Compatibility-Statement License (CSL)

1.  You must state on the first page where you mention Cepheus Engine
    that "Cepheus Engine and Samardan Press are the trademarks of Jason
    "Flynn" Kemp," and that you are not affiliated with Jason "Flynn"
    Kemp or Samardan Press™

2.  If you're using the license to commit legal fraud, you forfeit the
    right to continue using the license: specifically, if you are
    claiming compatibility with the rules of Cepheus Engine, the claim
    must not constitute legal fraud, or fraud in the inducement, under
    the laws of the State of Texas. Note that this requirement is almost
    impossible to violate unintentionally-it's largely intended to keep
    me out of trouble, not to restrict legitimate statements of
    compatibility.

3.  You must comply with the terms of the OGL if the terms apply.

4.  Your cover must include the words "House Rules" or "Variant Rules"
    or "Alternate Cepheus Engine Universe" near the title if the
    document is a full, free-standing game that includes modifications.
    Feel free to contact the author if you wish to use a different form
    of disclaimer.

5.  Selling a full version of this game with your house rules
    incorporated into it is perfectly permissible, but you may not sell
    an effectively unchanged copy of the rules for money.

6.  If your document is a private house rules document, not being sold
    for profit or general use, you may scan and use artwork (including
    the cover) from the printed version, published in print under the
    title of **Cepheus Engine Core Rules**, provided that the cover
    contains the words "House Rules," near the title, and that the
    artists are appropriately credited.

7.  Your rights under this CSL cannot be revoked, and are perpetual,
    unless you breach the terms of the license, in which case your
    rights terminate.

8.  If you comply with the above, you may state that your resource is
    "for use with the Cepheus Engine Core Rules", "compatible with the
    core rules of Cepheus Engine" or "with the Cepheus Engine Core
    Rules."

If you have questions about the license, feel free to contact the
author.
